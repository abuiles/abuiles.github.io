      As one of the early engineers at Envoy, Adolfo had a huge impact in our engineering team. He cares deeply about things and is always going above and beyond to make things better. He was also responsible for building our product engineering team (fully-remote) which is one of the most effective, welcoming and knitted team I have seen. If you are an early stage company, Adolfo is the kind of person you need in your team.

      We hired Adolfo as remote contract lead developer for our startup back in 2013, and he was outstanding from the very start. His expertise in RoR and EmberJS are outstanding, and he took a keen interest in our product, how our customers used it, and Adolfo was always proactive in suggesting both product and technology improvements. We truly enjoyed working with Adolfo, stayed in touch after he left, and I would recommend Adolfo for any technology project in a heartbeat.

We hired Adolfo when From the Farmer needed to scale. He was reliable, great at communication, proactive and always asking the right questions to help us solve our customers problems. He was open to giving us product advice and even helped us put together a team of remote engineers, many of whom we still work with today. I wouldn't hesitate to hire Adolfo again for any future projects for From the Farmer or any other venture / idea.
