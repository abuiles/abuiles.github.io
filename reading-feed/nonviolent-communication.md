> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=406)

> To arrive at a mutual desire to give from the heart, we focus the light of consciousness on four areas—referred to as the four components of the NVC model.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=406)

> First, we observe what is actually happening in a situation: what are we observing others saying or doing that is either enriching or not enriching our life?
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=407)

> Next, we state how we feel when we observe this action: are we hurt, scared, joyful, amused, irritated?
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=410)

> And thirdly, we say what needs of ours are connected to the feelings we have identified.

> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=418)

> The other part of this communication consists of receiving the same four pieces of information from others. We connect with them by first sensing what they are observing, feeling, and needing; then we discover what would enrich their lives by receiving the fourth piece—their request.

> NVC helps us connect with each other and ourselves in a way that allows our natural compassion to flourish. It guides us to reframe the way we express ourselves and listen to others by focusing our consciousness on four areas: what we are observing, feeling, and needing, and what we are requesting to enrich our lives.

## 2 Communication That Blocks Compassion

> Certain ways of communicating alienate us from our natural state of compassion.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=539)

> Moralistic Judgments One kind of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who don’t act in harmony with our values.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=540)

> In the world of judgments, our concern centers on “who is what.”
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=549)

> It is my belief that all such analyses of other human beings are tragic expressions of our own values and needs. They are tragic because when we express our values and needs in this form, we increase defensiveness and resistance among the very people whose behaviors are of concern to us.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=560)

> It is important here not to confuse value judgments and moralistic judgments. All of us make value judgments as to the qualities we value in life; for example, we might value honesty, freedom, or peace. Value judgments reflect our beliefs of how life can best be served. We make moralistic judgments of people and behaviors that fail to support our value judgments; for example, “Violence is bad. People who kill others are evil.”
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=568)

> For example, instead of “Violence is bad,” we might say instead, “I am fearful of the use of violence to resolve conflicts; I value the resolution of human conflicts through other means.”

> Classifying and judging people promotes violence.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=582)

> Making Comparisons Another form of judgment is the use of comparisons.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=589)

> Another kind of life-alienating communication is denial of responsibility. Communication is life-alienating when it clouds our awareness that we are each responsible for our own thoughts, feelings, and actions.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=604)

> We deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to factors outside ourselves:
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=614)

> We can replace language that implies lack of choice with language that acknowledges choice.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=633)

> We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=641)

## Other Forms of Life-Alienating Communication

> Communicating our desires as demands is yet another form of language that blocks compassion.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=651)

> Thinking based on “who deserves what” blocks compassionate communication.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=665)

> the more people are trained to think in terms of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness and badness, the more they are being trained to look outside themselves—to outside authorities—for the definition of what constitutes right, wrong, good, and bad. When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we humans no longer make good slaves and underlings.

> Summary It is our nature to enjoy giving and receiving compassionately. We have, however, learned many forms of life-alienating communication that lead us to speak and behave in ways that injure others and ourselves. One form of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of those who don’t act in harmony with our values. Another is the use of comparisons, which can block compassion both for others and for ourselves. Life-alienating communication also obscures our awareness that we are each responsible for our own thoughts, feelings, and actions. Communicating our desires in the form of demands is yet another characteristic of language that blocks compassion.

## 3 Observing Without Evaluating

> 3 Observing Without Evaluating
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=685)

> The first component of NVC entails the separation of observation from evaluation. We need to clearly observe what we are seeing, hearing, or touching that is affecting our sense of well-being, without mixing in any evaluation.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=703)

> When we combine observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.

> The Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti once remarked that observing without evaluating is the highest form of human intelligence.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=750)

> For most of us, it is difficult to make observations, especially of people and their behavior, that are free of judgment, criticism, or other

> The first component of NVC is to observe without evaluating; the second component is to express how we are feeling.

> Expressing our vulnerability can help resolve conflicts.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=931)

> In general, feelings are not being clearly expressed when the word feel is followed by: Words such as that, like, as if: “I feel that you should know better.” “I feel like a failure.” “I feel as if I’m living with a wall.” The pronouns I, you, he, she, they, it: “I feel I am constantly on call.” “I feel it is useless.” Names or nouns referring to people: “I feel Amy has been pretty responsible.” “I feel my boss is being manipulative.”

> Distinguish feelings from thoughts.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=954)

> in the English language, it is not necessary to use the word feel at all when we are actually expressing a feeling: we can say, “I’m feeling irritated,” or simply, “I’m irritated.”
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=954)

> Distinguish between what we feel and what we think we are.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=957)

> In NVC, we distinguish between words that express actual feelings and those that describe what we think we are.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=958)

> Distinguish between what we feel and how we think others react or behave toward us.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=968)

> The second component necessary for expressing ourselves is feelings. By developing a vocabulary of feelings that allows us to clearly and specifically name or identify our emotions, we can connect more easily with one another. Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts. NVC distinguishes the expression of actual feelings from words and statements that describe thoughts, assessments, and interpretations.

## 5 Taking Responsibility for Our Feelings

> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=1168)

> The third component of NVC entails the acknowledgment of the root of our feelings. NVC heightens our awareness that what others say and do may be the stimulus, but never the cause, of our feelings. We see that our feelings result from how we choose to receive what others say and do, as well as from our particular needs and expectations in that moment. With this third component, we are led to accept responsibility for what we do to generate our own feelings.

> Judgments, criticisms, diagnoses, and interpretations of others are all alienated expressions of our needs. If someone says, “You never understand me,” they are really telling us that their need to be understood is not being fulfilled.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=1231)

> When we express our needs indirectly through the use of evaluations, interpretations, and images, others are likely to hear criticism. And when people hear anything that sounds like criticism, they tend to invest their energy in self-defense or counterattack.

> In our development toward a state of emotional liberation, most of us experience three stages in the way we relate to others.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=1308)

> Stage 1: In this stage, which I refer to as emotional slavery, we believe ourselves responsible for the feelings of others.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=1309)

> Stage 2: In this stage, we become aware of the high costs of assuming responsibility for others’ feelings and trying to accommodate them at our own expense. When we notice how much of our lives we’ve missed and how little we have responded to the call of our own soul, we may get angry.
> [Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=1329)

> Stage 3: At the third stage, emotional liberation, we respond to the needs of others out of compassion, never out of fear, guilt, or shame. Our actions are therefore fulfilling to us, as well as to those who receive our efforts. We accept full responsibility for our own intentions and actions, but not for the feelings of others.
