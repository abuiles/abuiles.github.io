  <p>that which came with the help of luck could be taken away by luck (and often rapidly and unexpectedly at that). The flipside, which deserves to be considered as well (in fact it is even more of our concern), is that things that come with little help from luck are more resistant to randomness. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=560">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>A word on the display of emotions. Almost no one can conceal his emotions. Behavioral scientists believe that one of the main reasons why people become leaders is not from what skills they seem to possess, but rather from what extremely superficial impression they make on others through hardly perceptible physical signals—what we call today “charisma,” for example. The biology of the phenomenon is now well studied under the subject heading “social emotions.” Meanwhile some historian will “explain” the success in terms of, perhaps, tactical skills, the right education, or some other theoretical reason seen in hindsight. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=777">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>one cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e., if history played out in a different way).

<blockquote>
  <p>Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have hundreds, even thousands, of chambers instead of six. After a few dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a numbing false sense of security. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=876">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mind. In addition to such problems with the perception of risk, it is also a scientific fact, and a shocking one, that both risk detection and risk avoidance are not mediated in the “thinking” part of the brain but largely in the emotional one (the “risk as feelings” theory). The consequences are not trivial: It means that rational thinking has little, very little, to do with risk avoidance. Much of what rational thinking seems to do is rationalize one’s actions by fitting some logic to them. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1054">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>This is one of the many reasons that journalism may be the greatest plague we face today—as the world becomes more and more complicated and our minds are trained for more and more simplification. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1069">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Borrowed wisdom can be vicious. I need to make a huge effort not to be swayed by well-sounding remarks. I remind myself of Einstein’s remark that common sense is nothing but a collection of misconceptions acquired by age eighteen.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a platitude that children learn only from their own mistakes; they will cease to touch a burning stove only when they are themselves burned; no possible warning by others can lead to developing the smallest form of cautiousness. Adults, too, suffer from such a condition. This point has been examined by behavioral economics pioneers Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky with regard to the choices people make in selecting risky medical treatments <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1256">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only way I developed a respect for history is by making myself aware of the fact that I was not programmed to learn from it in a textbook format. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1269">Open in Kindle</a></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Experts call one manifestation of such denigration of history historical determinism. In a nutshell we think that we would know when history is made; we believe that people who, say, witnessed the stock market crash of 1929 knew then that they lived an acute historical event and that, should these events repeat themselves, they too would know about such facts. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1290">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(It takes a huge investment in introspection to learn that the thirty or more hours spent “studying” the news last month neither had any predictive ability during your activities of that month nor did it impact your current knowledge of the world. This problem is similar to the weaknesses in our ability to correct for past errors: Like a health club membership taken out to satisfy a New Year’s resolution, people often think that it will surely be the next batch of news that will really make a difference to their understanding of things.) <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1378">Open in Kindle</a></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>if we take the ratio of noise to what we call nonnoise (i.e., left column/right column), which we have the privilege here of examining quantitatively, then we have the following. Over one year we observe roughly 0.7 parts noise for every one part performance. Over one month, we observe roughly 2.32 parts noise for every one part performance. Over one hour, 30 parts noise for every one part performance, and over one second, 1,796 parts noise for every one part performance. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1461">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, this explains why people who look too closely at randomness burn out, their emotions drained by the series of pangs they experience. Regardless of what people claim, a negative pang is not offset by a positive one (some psychologists estimate the negative effect for an average loss to be up to 2.5 the magnitude of a positive one); it will lead to an emotional deficit. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1479">Open in Kindle</a></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not need to be rational and scientific when it comes to the details of our daily life—only in those that can harm us and threaten our survival. Modern life seems to invite us to do the exact opposite; become extremely realistic and intellectual when it comes to such matters as religion and personal behavior, yet as irrational as possible when it comes to matters ruled by randomness (say, portfolio or real estate investments). <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1606">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marty O’Connell calls this the firehouse effect. He had observed that firemen with much downtime who talk to each other for too long come to agree on many things that an outside, impartial observer would find ludicrous (they develop political ideas that are very similar). Psychologists give it a fancier name, but my friend Marty has no training in behavioral sciences. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1711">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cross-sectional problem: At a given time in the market, the most successful traders are likely to be those that are best fit to the latest cycle. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1723">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a saying that bad traders divorce their spouse sooner than abandon their positions. Loyalty to ideas is not a good thing for traders, scientists—or anyone. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1812">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem comes, as everything else in this book, from randomness. Zoologists found that once randomness is injected into a system, the results can be quite surprising: What seems to be an evolution may be merely a diversion, and possibly regression. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1847">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Owing to the abrupt rare events, we do not live in a world where things “converge” continuously toward betterment. Nor do things in life move continuously at all. The belief in continuity was ingrained in our scientific culture until the early twentieth century. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1858">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is asymmetry. Those who die do so very early in the game, while those who live go on living very long. Whenever there is asymmetry in outcomes, the average survival has nothing to do with the median survival. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1894">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>have to say that bullish or bearish are often hollow words with no application in a world of randomness—particularly if such a world, like ours, presents asymmetric outcomes. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1916">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accordingly, it is not how likely an event is to happen that matters, it is how much is made when it happens that should be the consideration. How frequent the profit is irrelevant; it is the magnitude of the outcome that counts. It is a pure accounting fact that, aside from the commentators, very few people take home a check linked to how often they are right or wrong. What they get is a profit or loss. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1947">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I try to benefit from rare events, events that do not tend to repeat themselves frequently, but, accordingly, present a large payoff when they occur. I try to make money infrequently, as infrequently as possible, simply because I believe that rare events are not fairly valued, and that the rarer the event, the more undervalued it will be in price. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=1970">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as in finance, an event, although rare, that brings large consequences cannot just be ignored. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2004">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes market data becomes a simple trap; it shows you the opposite of its nature, simply to get you to invest in the security or mismanage your risks. Currencies that exhibit the largest historical stability, for example, are the most prone to crashes. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2032">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>we read too much into shallow recent history, with statements like “this has never happened before,” but not from history in general (things that never happened before in one area tend eventually to happen). In other words, history teaches us that things that never happened before do happen. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2039">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>history teaches us to avoid the brand of naive empiricism that consists of learning from casual historical facts. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2042">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I associate rare events with any misunderstanding of the risks derived from a narrow interpretation of past time series. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2052">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>Rare events are always unexpected, otherwise they would not occur. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2053">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>some economists call the rare event a “peso problem.” The designation peso problem does not appear to be undeservedly stereotypical. Things have not gotten better since the early 1980s with the currency of the United States’ southern neighbor. Long periods of stability draw hordes of bank currency traders and hedge fund operators to the calm waters of the Mexican peso; they enjoy owning the currency because of the high interest rate it commands. Then they “unexpectedly” blow up, lose money for investors, lose their jobs, and switch careers. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2066">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accordingly investors, merely for emotional reasons, will be drawn into strategies that experience rare but large variations. It is called pushing randomness under the rug. Psychologists recently found out that people tend to be sensitive to the presence or absence of a given stimulus rather than its magnitude. This implies that a loss is first perceived as just a loss, with further implications later. The same with profits. The agent would prefer the number of losses to be low and the number of gains to be high, rather than optimizing the total performance. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2079">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the markets, there is a category of traders who have inverse rare events, for whom volatility is often a bearer of good news. These traders lose money frequently, but in small amounts, and make money rarely, but in large amounts. I call them crisis hunters. I am happy to be one of them. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2094">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where statistics becomes complicated, and fails us, is when we have distributions that are not symmetric, like the urn above. If there is a very small probability of finding a red ball in an urn dominated by black ones, then our knowledge about the absence of red balls will increase very slowly—more slowly than at the expected square root of n rate. On the other hand, our knowledge of the presence of red balls will dramatically improve once one of them is found. This asymmetry in knowledge is not trivial; <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2103">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The very same effect takes place in the market. We take past history as a single homogeneous sample and believe that we have considerably increased our knowledge of the future from the observation of the sample of the past. What if vicious children were changing the composition of the urn? In other words, what if things have changed? <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2115">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the economist Robert Lucas dealt a blow to econometrics by arguing that if people were rational then their rationality would cause them to figure out predictable patterns from the past and adapt, so that past information would be completely useless for predicting the future <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2128">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In his Treatise on Human Nature, the Scots philosopher David Hume posed the issue in the following way (as rephrased in the now famous black swan problem by John Stuart Mill): No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2155">Open in Kindle</a></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>markets (and life) are not simple win/lose types of situations, as the cost of the losses can be markedly different from that of the wins. Maximizing the probability of winning does not lead to maximizing the expectation from the game when one’s strategy may include skewness, i.e., a small chance of large loss and a large chance of a small win. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2215">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I also learned to stay away from people of a competitive nature, as they have a tendency to commoditize and reduce the world to categories, like how many papers they publish in a given year, or how they rank in the league tables. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2223">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>To conclude, extreme empiricism, competitiveness, and an absence of logical structure to one’s inference can be a quite explosive combination. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2226">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are only two types of theories: 1. Theories that are known to be wrong, as they were tested and adequately rejected (he calls them falsified). 2. Theories that have not yet been known to be wrong, not falsified yet, but are exposed to be proved wrong. Why is a theory never right? Because we will never know if all the swans are white <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2292">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>I want to take the best of what the past can give me without its dangers. Accordingly, I will use statistics and inductive methods to make aggressive bets, but I will not use them to manage my risks and exposure. Surprisingly, all the surviving traders I know seem to have done the same. They trade on ideas based on some observation (that includes past history) but, like the Popperian scientists, they make sure that the costs of being wrong are limited (and their probability is not derived from past data). <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2359">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>But as compared to his co-op neighbors, he is at the bottom! Why? Because he chose to live among the people who have been successful, in an area that excludes failure. In other words, those who have failed do not show up in the sample, thus making him look as if he were not doing well at all. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2464">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mistake of ignoring the survivorship bias is chronic, even (or perhaps especially) among professionals. How? Because we are trained to take advantage of the information that is lying in front of our eyes, ignoring the information that we do not see. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2524">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A brief summing up at this point: I showed how we tend to mistake one realization among all possible random histories as the most representative one, forgetting that there may be others. In a nutshell, the survivorship bias implies that the highest performing realization will be the most visible. Why? Because the losers do not show up. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2529">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>Optimism, it is said, is predictive of success. Predictive? It can also be predictive of failure. Optimistic people certainly take more risks as they are overconfident about the odds; those who win show up among the rich and famous, others fail and disappear from the analyses. Sadly. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2549">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just like the helical propulsion of an actor into stardom, people patronize what other people like to do. Forcing rational dynamics on the process would be superfluous, nay, impossible. This is called a path dependent outcome, and has thwarted many mathematical attempts at modeling behavior. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2929">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I said in Chapter 3, mathematics is merely a way of thinking and meditating, little more, in our world of randomness. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2968">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Owing to this nonlinearity, people cannot comprehend the nature of the rare event. This summarizes why there are routes to success that are nonrandom, but few, very few, people have the mental stamina to follow them. Those who go the extra mile are rewarded. In my profession one may own a security that benefits from lower market prices, but may not react at all until some critical point. Most people give up before the rewards. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=2989">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Too much success is the enemy (think of the punishment meted out on the rich and famous); too much failure is demoralizing. I would like the option of having neither. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=3012">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, when something is in relation to something else, that something else can be manipulated. Psychologists call this effect of comparing to a given reference anchoring. If we take it to its logical limit we would realize that, because of this resetting, wealth itself does not really make one happy (above, of course, some subsistence level); but positive changes in wealth may, especially if they come as “steady” increases. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=3177">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>They agree that our brains are not made for understanding things but think that they are not biased, or only biased because we do not use them in their real habitat. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=3238">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>(1) We do not think when making choices but use heuristics; (2) We make serious probabilistic mistakes in today’s world—whatever the true reason. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=3244">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>Professionals forget the following reality. It is not the estimate or the forecast that matters so much as the degree of confidence with the opinion. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=3518">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we are not made to view things as independent from each other. When viewing two events A and B, it is hard not to assume that A causes B, B causes A, or both cause each other. Our bias is immediately to establish a causal link. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=3674">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=3796">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The scientist’s behavior while facing the refutation of his ideas has been studied in depth as part of the so-called attribution bias.

<blockquote>
  <p>Causality is not clear: The question remains whether optimizers are unhappy because they are constantly seeking a better deal or if unhappy people tend to optimize out of their misery. In any case, randomness seems to operate either as a cure or as Novocain! <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B001FA0W5W&amp;location=4042">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>It took me an entire lifetime to find out what my generator is. It is: We favor the visible, the embedded, the personal, the narrated, and the tangible; we scorn the abstract.
