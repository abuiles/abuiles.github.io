  <p>THE TECH FALLACY REVISITED Selling porn taught me about the Tech Fallacy. I had believed that building great technology must mean that you’re building a great business. That it was all about the tech. But selling porn taught me that the raison d’être for any business is to give the customer what he wants. He doesn’t want the tech; he wants what the tech can deliver. The tech is just the means to an end.

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea that raising investment is a mark of success—and a badge of honor—is the Investment Fallacy. Investment is a burden as much as—or more than—an opportunity. It increases the pressure, corrupts your incentives, and creates a communications minefield. Court it at your peril.

  <p>If your startup clearly needs an investment in order to reach its market, then you are entitled to take some satisfaction from successfully raising that investment.

<h2 id="the-failure-is-not-an-option-fallacy">The “Failure is not an option” Fallacy</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Failure is not an option” is one of the most beloved mantras of gurus everywhere. It is a fallacy. Failure is not a choice: it is an outcome. That outcome may come about as a result of your mistakes; or it may come about as a result of events outside your control. Either way, making the right choices about how to handle that failure is a crucial step to ultimate business success. The trick is not to act like failure is not an option—the trick is to know when failure is the right option.

<blockquote>
  <p>All startup founders need a failure plan: a plan for how to identify when your company has failed, what to do to shut it down, and how to do it. Who do you go to? How much does it cost? (Yes, closing a company costs money.) What sort of severance and notice for staff do you need to budget for?

<blockquote>
  <p>TAKEAWAY: HOW TO AVOID THE “FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION” FALLACY Plan for failure. Don’t expect to fail—but do expect that you might fail. Learn about the process of closing down a business: how to do it fairly and efficiently. Set negative targets: if you hit these, despite your best efforts, then you automatically trigger your failure plan and start winding down the company. Failing this way means you’re more likely to retain the loyalty of your colleagues and the respect of your clients and customers. And that makes you more likely to bounce back and succeed the next time.

<blockquote>
  <p>The Expert Fallacy is the belief that the experts know best. In startup culture, the Expert Fallacy leads many a founder to rely on the analysis of established experts when, by definition, nobody can be an expert in a new product, service or market. You do need to learn from the experience of others. You do need to take good advice. You do need to study your field. But there’s a time and a place for experts. Choosing that time and place—and being ready to disregard the experts outside of that—is a hard-won skill

  <p>The Idea Fallacy afflicts not just the tech sector, but the wider culture. The Idea Fallacy is the deep-rooted belief that what really counts is the idea, not the implementation. There’s nothing wrong with a good idea—but an idea without implementation is largely worthless. Good ideas are far less rare than we think—what’s really scarce is the ability to execute.

<blockquote>
  <p>The Idea Fallacy is the belief that inspiration, not perspiration, is the fount of creative success, whether in the arts, the creative industries, or in startups. It is the belief that the root of success lies in the idea rather than the execution—the belief that ideas have substantial intrinsic value—that they are the key item in the startup value chain.

  <p>Rarely is an idea original. Society’s focus on the “Big Idea” is misplaced. As Jim Collins shows in Great by Choice, many of our business icons build their success on the back of other people’s ideas: it wasn’t the McDonald brothers who built McDonald’s into an empire, it was Ray Kroc who saw the seed of greater success in their operation and bought it from them.

If you have skills they can use, sell them. Use those skills to get inside other corporate and creative environments so you can learn from other people’s mistakes before you have to learn from your own. When you want to build your own scalable startup, build it on the foundation of your services business. It will be stronger and more nimble, and you’ll have a cushion if it collapses.

  <p>The L’Oréal Fallacy is the belief that you should hold out for the exit you deserve—because you’re worth it. This fallacy corrupts decision making at a crucial point—the point when monetary success is actually a tangible prospect. First-time founders, in particular, should take their exit when they can. Get out, go on a holiday, and then get back in the game. Instead of holding out for a better exit, move on and create one with a new product.

  <p>Suddenly, after years of failure, I was hot. The success of RightCart made me the archetypal “overnight success” that has actually been ten years in the making.

  <p>I’ve stopped relying on what I think I’m worth. My equity is worth what the market will pay and only worth that when the market will pay it.

<blockquote>
  <p>TAKEAWAY: HOW TO AVOID THE L’ORÉAL FALLACY It doesn’t matter how much work you’ve put in or how great your idea is. There is no magic sum that you are “worth.” There is only what the market will pay. That will change for reasons outside your control, and it may go down as well as up. Take the money. And don’t look back. So take your exit.

<h2 id="the-quality-fallacy">The Quality Fallacy</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Quality Fallacy is the belief that quality is a goal in itself—that your product should be as good as it can be before bringing it to market. On the contrary, quality is a distraction. Your product should be only as good as it needs to be to be brought to market. Anything more is a waste. Waste will undermine your company in the long run and lower the chance of your product finding market success. Focus your energies and resources where they’re most needed: build a minimum viable product (MVP); then concentrate on getting that to market and getting customers to it. Think of an MVP as a “Franken-product” – something cobbled together out of whatever’s lying around.

<blockquote>
  <p>As a creative, self-starter type, I had seen building things as the challenge and the attraction. Crandell taught me that it wasn’t the building that was the challenging part: it was the selling. To sell something, you have to know the market wants it. To find out if the market wants the product, you have to ask it.

<blockquote>
  <p>The Quality Fallacy is the belief that that the time to ask the market is when you can present it with a perfected product: only then will you be able to truly tell how it responds.

<blockquote>
  <p>So the trick is to bring your product to market as early as possible. You should launch products when they are barely working—when they are “minimally viable”: a minimum viable product (MVP).

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>the minimum amount of time and money should be invested in product development and the maximum in channeling customers to the product. That gives you the vital information you need: is your product viable? If it is, then you can shift to a focus on quality and customer retention.

  <p>You should be proud of your product and business in the long term. Making it a success may mean being willing to work with a Franken-product in the short term.

<blockquote>
  <p>TAKEAWAY: HOW TO AVOID THE QUALITY FALLACY Your product doesn’t need to be finished to bring it to market—it just needs to work. Build a Franken-product—a minimum viable product—as quickly and cheaply as you can and release that to the market. Use the market’s feedback to refine your product so that you know you’re working on something the market wants, not something you think the market needs.

<h2 id="the-passion-fallacy">The Passion Fallacy</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Passion Fallacy is the belief that passion should drive your startup—that the magic ingredient is your belief in your product. On the contrary, passion clouds judgment. I want to see evidence of cold, hard business acumen before I invest in a startup; that can exist alongside passion, sure, but more often founders seem to think that passion is an acceptable substitute.

<blockquote>
  <p>The model I am trying to explain to him is a performance model rather than a partner model. The essence of the performance model is that you can “force-feed” your market in order to test the performance of your product in the market from the earliest stages of its development. Instead of waiting for your market to miraculously discover you, or for your partners or even the media to push you out to the market, you can proactively push your product into the market.

<blockquote>
  <p>But I’m not interested in ideas. And I’m not interested in passion. In fact, passion worries me. Too often, it hides other weaknesses. I’m interested in execution. And “execution” doesn’t mean “tech.” As we’ve seen, the pursuit of good tech leads to the Tech Fallacy—the focus on tech for tech’s sake. All I want from the tech is a clunky prototype—a Franken-product, or MVP—that allows for some market testing. “Execution” means the ability to bring a product to market.

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s easy to get blinded by the idea you’re passionate about—to be fixated on your fix. It’s only natural to assume that there are others out there like you seeing the same problem and wishing there was a ready-made solution to it. And there may well be many others. But are they willing to pay for it? And can you even find them to ask them?

<blockquote>
  <p>The Passion Fallacy is the belief that your passion should determine what you bring to market, and drive it there. It shouldn’t. You are your worst test market because you are a market of one.

<h2 id="the-san-francisco-fallacy">The San Francisco Fallacy</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the face of it, the San Francisco Fallacy may seem trivial by comparison with the ten fallacies we’ve just examined. A piece of geographical advice—“Don’t move to San Francisco”—hardly ranks up there with core lessons of business. But the San Francisco Fallacy is symptomatic of a broader and deeper danger in the culture—the danger of groupthink. The urge to base tech startups in San Francisco is a very literal example of herding behavior, whereby members of a community have an instinctive tendency to follow each other.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This kind of analysis will always be more difficult if you surround yourself with people whose interests, culture, and working environments are the same. Seeing through groupthink requires you to stand apart from the herd. In the first place, that’s a mental and emotional discipline. But it doesn’t help if you live and work surrounded by the herd.

  <p>Find somewhere cheaper, with better talent, that is more in touch with the mainstream. Build your business based on the values in this book, not on desire, dreams, or passion. But of course, you’ll need something else—something no book can give you and no experience can guarantee: Good luck.
