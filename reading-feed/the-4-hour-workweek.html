<p>Forget the old concept of retirement and the rest of the deferred-life plan–there is no need to wait and every reason not to, especially in unpredictable economic times. Whether your dream is escaping the rat race, experiencing high-end world travel, or earning a monthly five-figure income with zero management, The 4-Hour Workweek is the blueprint.</p>

<p>People is always preparing for “retirement” at 60 or somewhere in the future instead of enjoying what they have and can do today. (<strong>Read Seneca on the shortness of life for some extra ideas about this same theme</strong>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‌Life doesn’t have to be so damn hard. It really doesn’t. Most people, my past self included, have spent too much time convincing themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery in exchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=258">Read more</a>‌</p>

<p>To become a NR follow the <strong>DEAL</strong> process</p>

You spent two weeks negotiating your new Infiniti with the dealership and got $10,000 off? That’s great. Does your life have a purpose?

<blockquote>
  <p>D: To have freedom from doing that which you dislike. NR: To have freedom from doing that which you dislike, but also the freedom and resolve to pursue your dreams without reverting to work for work’s sake (W4W). After years of repetitive work, you will often need to dig hard to find your passions, redefine your dreams, and revive hobbies that you let atrophy to near extinction. The goal is not to simply eliminate the bad, which does nothing more than leave you with a vacuum, but to pursue and experience the best in the world.<cite><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=453">Read more</a></cite></p>

<p><strong>Adding more money is not the answer, is laziness.</strong></p>

<p>“If only I had more money” is the easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life of enjoyment— now and not later. By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming routine, we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves the time to do otherwise:</p>

<p><strong>Absolute vs Relative income. Always look at income relatively!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours. The whole “per year” concept is arbitrary and makes it easy to trick yourself.<cite><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=671">Read more</a></cite></p>

  <p>Let’s look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and works 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per hour. John Doe makes $50,000 per year, $1,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, but works 10 hours per week and hence makes $100 per hour.<cite><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=672">Read more</a></cite></p>

  <p>Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for “healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.<cite><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=683">Read more</a></cite></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it’s six days of making a mountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster.

<blockquote>
  <p>First and foremost, there is a difference between being perceived as an expert and being one. In the context of business, the former is what sells product and the latter, relative to your “minimal customer base,” is what creates good products and prevents returns. It is possible to know all there is to know about a subject—medicine, for example—but if you don’t have M.D. at the end of your name, few will listen. The M.D. is what I term a “credibility indicator.” The so-called expert with the most credibility indicators, whether acronyms or affiliations, is often the most successful in the marketplace, even if other candidates have more in-depth knowledge. This is a matter of superior positioning, not deception.<cite><a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=2748">Read more</a></cite></p>
