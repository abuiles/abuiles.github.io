**NR** = New Rich = **Their currency is time and mobility**

**LD** = Lyfestyle design

**D =** Deferrers

> ‌The New Rich (NR) are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility. This is an art and a science we will refer to as Lifestyle Design (LD).[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=253)‌

People is always preparing for "retirement" at 60 or somewhere in the future instead of enjoying what they have and can do today. (**Read Seneca on the shortness of life for some extra ideas about this same theme**)

> ‌Life doesn’t have to be so damn hard. It really doesn’t. Most people, my past self included, have spent too much time convincing themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery in exchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation.[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=258)‌

To become a NR follow the **DEAL** process

*   **D** = Definition
*   **E** = Eliminate => Brings **time**
*   **A** = Automation => Brings **money**
*   **L** = Liberation  => Brings **mobility**

**Time, money and mobility are the main ingreatiens of for a luxury LD (lifestyle design)**

**Find a market before designing a product.**

## D for Definition

Differences between the **New Rich (options)** and the **Deferrer (those who save it all for the end)**

> What separates the New Rich, characterized by options, from the Deferrers (D), those who save it all for the end only to find that life has passed them by?<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=431)</cite>

> D: To work for yourself. NR: To have others work for you.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=436)</cite>

> D: To work when you want to. NR: To prevent work for work’s sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (“minimum effective load”).<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=437)</cite>

> D: To work when you want to. NR: To prevent work for work’s sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (“minimum effective load”).<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=437)</cite>

> D: To retire early or young. NR: To distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis and recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=439)</cite>

> D: To buy all the things you want to have. NR: To do all the things you want to do, and be all the things you want to be. If this includes some tools and gadgets, so be it, but they are either means to an end or bonuses, not the focus.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=441)</cite>

> D: To make a ton of money. NR: To make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams to chase, timelines and steps included. What are you working for?<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=445)</cite>

> D: To have more. NR: To have more quality and less clutter. To have huge financial reserves but recognize that most material wants are justifications for spending time on the things that don’t really matter, including buying things and preparing to buy things. You spent two weeks negotiating your new Infiniti with the dealership and got $10,000 off? That’s great. Does your life have a purpose? Are you contributing anything useful to this world, or just shuffling papers, banging on a keyboard, and coming home to a drunken existence on the weekends?<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=447)</cite>

> D: To reach the big pay-off, whether IPO, acquisition, retirement, or other pot of gold. NR: To think big but ensure payday comes every day: cash flow first, big payday second.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=451)</cite>

> D: To have freedom from doing that which you dislike. NR: To have freedom from doing that which you dislike, but also the freedom and resolve to pursue your dreams without reverting to work for work’s sake (W4W). After years of repetitive work, you will often need to dig hard to find your passions, redefine your dreams, and revive hobbies that you let atrophy to near extinction. The goal is not to simply eliminate the bad, which does nothing more than leave you with a vacuum, but to pursue and experience the best in the world.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=453)</cite>

**Being rich and to live like a millionaire are two very different things**

### Money on its own is not practical - Money *W's is practical - What, when, how and with whom you do thing is what counts. W's => Freedom Multiplier

> Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: what you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the “freedom multiplier.”<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=466)</cite>

What's the point of making $500K/Y if we are working the whole time?

**Is "richer" the person who does $50k/y and works 10 hours week than the one that makes $100K/y and works 80 hours.**

> Using this as our criterion, the 80-hour-per-week, $500,000-per-year investment banker is less “powerful” than the employed NR who works ¼ the hours for $40,000, but has complete freedom of when, where, and how to live.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=468)</cite>

## What's power?

> Options—the ability to choose—is real power.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=472)</cite>

Get options, control your Ws

**Most people are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the way if you’re moving. Get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up.**

> 6\. Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=636)</cite>

**Focus on what you are good at -** The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair.

> 7\. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=643)</cite>

**Too much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes what you don't want.**

> 8\. Money Alone Is Not the Solution.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=652)</cite>

**Adding more money is not the answer, is lazines.**

“If only I had more money” is the easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life of enjoyment— now and not later. By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming routine, we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves the time to do otherwise:

> 9\. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=662)</cite>

**Absolute vs Relative income. Always look at income relatively!**

> Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours. The whole “per year” concept is arbitrary and makes it easy to trick yourself.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=671)</cite>

> Let’s look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and works 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per hour. John Doe makes $50,000 per year, $1,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, but works 10 hours per week and hence makes $100 per hour.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=672)</cite>

> 10\. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=679)</cite>

**Do things and surround yourself with people that  push you and give you exciment.**

> Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for “healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=683)</cite>

> 6\. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action?<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=842)</cite>

### A person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.

## Is easier to do the unrealistic than the realistic - the adrenaline infusion helps with it

> Doing the Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=886)</cite>

> Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance to overcome the inevitable trials and tribulations that go along with any goal.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=893)</cite>

### People thing they want happiness, no! They want exciment!

> Let’s assume we have 10 goals and we achieve them—what is the desired outcome that makes all the effort worthwhile? The most common response is what I also would have suggested five years ago: happiness. I no longer believe this is a good answer. Happiness<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=908)</cite>

> Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=913)</cite>

## The big question is: "What would excite me"

> Remember—boredom is the enemy, not some abstract “failure.”<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=941)</cite>

### Dreamlining = Focus on achieable goals and steps

> Dreamlining is so named because it applies timelines to what most would consider dreams. It is much like goal-setting but differs in several fundamental respects: 1\. The goals shift from ambiguous wants to defined steps. 2\. The goals have to be unrealistic to be effective. 3\. It focuses on activities that will fill the vacuum created when work is removed. Living like a millionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=945)</cite>
