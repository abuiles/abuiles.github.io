# The 4-Hour Workweek

Some times people think they can only do things if they have millions, but that's not always the case.

> ‌People don’t want to be millionaires—they want to experience what they believe only millions can buy.[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=267)‌

**NR** = New Rich = **Their currency is time and mobility**

**LD** = Lifestyle design

**D =** Deferrers

**W4W =** Work for work

> ‌The New Rich (NR) are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility. This is an art and a science we will refer to as Lifestyle Design (LD).[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=253)‌

People is always preparing for "retirement" at 60 or somewhere in the future instead of enjoying what they have and can do today. (**Read Seneca on the shortness of life for some extra ideas about this same theme**)

> ‌Life doesn’t have to be so damn hard. It really doesn’t. Most people, my past self included, have spent too much time convincing themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery in exchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation.[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=258)‌

To become a NR follow the **DEAL** process

*   **D** = Definition
*   **E** = Eliminate => Brings **time**
*   **A** = Automation => Brings **money**
*   **L** = Liberation  => Brings **mobility**

**Time, money and mobility are the main ingredients  of for a luxury LD (lifestyle design)**

# Step 1: Definition

> Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one. —ALBERT EINSTEIN<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=408)</cite>

Differences between the **New Rich (options)** and the **Deferrer (those who save it all for the end)**

> What separates the New Rich, characterized by options, from the Deferrers (D), those who save it all for the end only to find that life has passed them by?<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=431)</cite>

> D: To work for yourself. NR: To have others work for you.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=436)</cite>

> D: To work when you want to. NR: To prevent work for work’s sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (“minimum effective load”).<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=437)</cite>

> D: To work when you want to. NR: To prevent work for work’s sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (“minimum effective load”).<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=437)</cite>

> D: To retire early or young. NR: To distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis and recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=439)</cite>

> D: To buy all the things you want to have. NR: To do all the things you want to do, and be all the things you want to be. If this includes some tools and gadgets, so be it, but they are either means to an end or bonuses, not the focus.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=441)</cite>

> D: To make a ton of money. NR: To make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams to chase, timelines and steps included. What are you working for?<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=445)</cite>

> D: To have more. NR: To have more quality and less clutter. To have huge financial reserves but recognize that most material wants are justifications for spending time on the things that don’t really matter, including buying things and preparing to buy things. You spent two weeks negotiating your new Infiniti with the dealership and got $10,000 off? That’s great. Does your life have a purpose? Are you contributing anything useful to this world, or just shuffling papers, banging on a keyboard, and coming home to a drunken existence on the weekends?<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=447)</cite>

> D: To reach the big pay-off, whether IPO, acquisition, retirement, or other pot of gold. NR: To think big but ensure payday comes every day: cash flow first, big payday second.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=451)</cite>

> D: To have freedom from doing that which you dislike. NR: To have freedom from doing that which you dislike, but also the freedom and resolve to pursue your dreams without reverting to work for work’s sake (W4W). After years of repetitive work, you will often need to dig hard to find your passions, redefine your dreams, and revive hobbies that you let atrophy to near extinction. The goal is not to simply eliminate the bad, which does nothing more than leave you with a vacuum, but to pursue and experience the best in the world.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=453)</cite>

**Being rich and to live like a millionaire are two very different things**

### Freedom multiplier

**Money on its own is not practical - Money + W's is practical - What, when, how and with whom you do thing is what counts. W's => Freedom Multiplier**

> Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: what you do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the “freedom multiplier.”<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=466)</cite>

What's the point of making $500K/Y if we are working the whole time?

**it is "richer" the person who does $50k/y and works 10 hours week than the one that makes $100K/y and works 80 hours.**

> Using this as our criterion, the 80-hour-per-week, $500,000-per-year investment banker is less “powerful” than the employed NR who works ¼ the hours for $40,000, but has complete freedom of when, where, and how to live.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=468)</cite>

### What's power?

> Options—the ability to choose—is real power.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=472)</cite>

Get options, control your W's

### Fundamental rules for the NR

> 1\. Retirement Is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=587)</cite>

**Why do I want to retire if what I do brings me excitement? Boredom is the enemy**

> 2\. Interest and Energy Are Cyclical.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=602)</cite>

**Work and Rest**

> 3\. Less Is Not Laziness.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=613)</cite>

**Produce meaningful results in the few hours of work instead of focusing on being "busy"**

> Focus on being productive instead of busy.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=622)</cite>

> 4\. The Timing Is Never Right.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=623)</cite>

**“Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.**

> 5\. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=631)</cite>

**Most people are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the way if you’re moving. Get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up.**

> 6\. Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=636)</cite>

**Focus on what you are good at -** The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair.

> 7\. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=643)</cite>

**Too much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes what you don't want.**

> 8\. Money Alone Is Not the Solution.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=652)</cite>

**Adding more money is not the answer, is la laziness.**

“If only I had more money” is the easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life of enjoyment— now and not later. By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming routine, we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves the time to do otherwise:

> 9\. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=662)</cite>

**Absolute vs Relative income. Always look at income relatively!**

> Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours. The whole “per year” concept is arbitrary and makes it easy to trick yourself.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=671)</cite>

> Let’s look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and works 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per hour. John Doe makes $50,000 per year, $1,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, but works 10 hours per week and hence makes $100 per hour.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=672)</cite>

> 10\. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=679)</cite>

**Do things and surround yourself with people that  push you and give you excitement.**

> Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for “healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=683)</cite>

## Conquering Fear = Defining Fear

> Conquering Fear = Defining Fear<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=762)</cite>

**There isn't as much risk as we think on doing what we want, and worst case scenario we can always go back to the previous situation easily.**

> This all equated to a significant realization: There was practically no risk, only huge life-changing upside potential, and I could resume my previous course without any more effort than I was already putting forth.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=777)</cite>

> 6\. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action?<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=842)</cite>

## Uncovering Fear Disguised as Optimism

> Uncovering Fear Disguised as Optimism<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=781)</cite>

Optimistic denial - "I won't quit because I know I'll make more money after X"

**A person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.**

> As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=839)</cite>

> Fear comes in many forms, and we usually don’t call it by its four-letter name. Fear itself is quite fear-inducing. Most intelligent people in the world dress it up as something else: optimistic denial. Most who avoid quitting their jobs entertain the thought that their course will improve with time or increases in income.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=786)</cite>

> The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. —GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, Maxims for Revolutionists<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=863)</cite>

**Is easier to do the unrealistic than the realistic - the adrenaline infusion helps with it**

> Doing the Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=886)</cite>

> Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance to overcome the inevitable trials and tribulations that go along with any goal.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=893)</cite>

### People thing they want happiness, no! They want excitement!

> Let’s assume we have 10 goals and we achieve them—what is the desired outcome that makes all the effort worthwhile? The most common response is what I also would have suggested five years ago: happiness. I no longer believe this is a good answer. Happiness<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=908)</cite>

> Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=913)</cite>

## The big question is: "What would excite me"

> Remember—boredom is the enemy, not some abstract “failure.”<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=941)</cite>

### Dreamlining = Focus on achievable goals and steps

> Dreamlining is so named because it applies timelines to what most would consider dreams. It is much like goal-setting but differs in several fundamental respects: 1\. The goals shift from ambiguous wants to defined steps. 2\. The goals have to be unrealistic to be effective. 3\. It focuses on activities that will fill the vacuum created when work is removed. Living like a millionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=945)</cite>

## Comfort challenge

> The most important actions are never comfortable.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1081)</cite>

> To have an uncommon lifestyle, you need to develop the uncommon habit of making decisions, both for yourself and for others.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1083)</cite>

> From this chapter forward, I’ll take you through progressively more uncomfortable exercises, simple and small.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1084)</cite>

> Learn to Eye Gaze (2 days)<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1089)</cite>

> For the next two days, practice gazing into the eyes of others—whether people you pass on the street or conversational partners—until they break contact.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1092)</cite>

# Step 2: Elimination = This will bring you time

> Step II: E is for Elimination<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1099)</cite>

Forget about time management and results by volume -- **we don't have to work all the time**, the idea is to not work all the time and get time to do the things that excite us. **The steps in Elimination will help us increase productivity and gain more time to do what we want.**

**For employees:**

> They need to Liberate themselves from the office environment before they can work ten hours a week, for example, because the expectation in that environment is that you will be in constant motion from 9–5.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1129)</cite>

> increase your value<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1134)</cite>

**For entrepreneurs:**

> The entrepreneur’s goals are less complex, as he or she is generally the direct beneficiary of increased profit. The goal is to decrease the amount of work you perform while increasing revenue. This will set the stage for replacing yourself with Automation, which in turn permits Liberation.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1137)</cite>

## Effective vs Efficient

**Effectiveness =** doing the things that get you closer to your goals.

**Efficiency =** performing a given task in the most economical manner possible.

> Being Effective vs. Being Efficient Effectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your goals. Efficiency is performing a given task (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without regard to effectiveness is the default mode of the universe.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1140)</cite>

> Here are two truisms to keep in mind: 1\. Doing something unimportant well does not make it important. 2\. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1147)</cite>

> From this moment forward, remember this: What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it. Efficiency is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right things.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1150)</cite>

## Pareto: 80/20 principle

> Pareto’s Law can be summarized as follows: 80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs. Alternative ways to phrase this, depending on the context, include: 80% of the consequences flow from 20% of the causes.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1164)</cite>

> 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort and time. 80% of company profits come from 20% of the products and customers. 80% of all stock market gains are realized by 20% of the investors and 20% of an individual portfolio.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1166)</cite>

> Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference. Being busy is a form of laziness—lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1227)</cite>

## Parkinson's Law

> Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it’s six days of making a mountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1263)</cite>

## Approaches for increasing productivity

> 1\. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20).<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1269)</cite>

> 2\. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law).<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1270)</cite>

> The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1271)</cite>

> If you haven’t identified the mission-critical tasks and set aggressive start and end times for their completion, the unimportant becomes the important. Even if you know what’s critical, without deadlines that create focus, the minor tasks forced upon you (or invented, in the case of the entrepreneur) will swell to consume time until another bit of minutiae jumps in to replace it, leaving you at the end of the day with nothing accomplished.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1272)</cite>

> Most inputs are useless and time is wasted in proportion to the amount that is available.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1279)</cite>

Cultivate selective ignorance - **information consumes our attention!**

> What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence, a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. —HERBERT SIMON, recipient of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics8 and the A.M.

> From an actionable information standpoint, I consume a maximum of one-third of one industry magazine (Response magazine) and one business magazine (Inc.) per month, for a grand total of approximately four hours.

> 1\. I picked one book out of dozens based on reader reviews and the fact that the authors had actually done what I wanted to do. If the task is how-to in nature, I only read accounts that are “how I did it” and autobiographical. No speculators or wannabes are worth the time.<cite>[Read more](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=1452)</cite>

> I only read the sections of the book that were relevant to immediate next steps, which took less than two hours. To develop a template e-mail and call script took approximately four hours, and the actual e-mails and phone calls took less than an hour. This personal contact approach is not only more effective and more efficient than all-you-can-eat info buffets, it also provided me with the major league alliances and mentors necessary to sell this book.
