<p>“My Life and Work” is the autobiography of Henry Ford. Written in conjunction with Samuel Crowther, “My Life and Work” chronicles the rise and success of one of the greatest American entrepreneurs and businessmen. Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company will forever be identified with early 20th century American industrialism. The innovations to business and direct impact on the American economy of Henry Ford and his company are immeasurable. His story is brilliantly chronicled in this classic American biography.</p>

  <p>INTRODUCTION WHAT IS THE IDEA? <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=7">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think that unless we know more about machines and their use, unless we better understand the mechanical portion of life, we cannot have the time to enjoy the trees, and the birds, and the flowers, and the green fields. I think that we have already done too much toward banishing the pleasant things from life by thinking that there is some opposition between living and providing the means of living. We waste so much time and energy that we have little left over in which to enjoy ourselves. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=15">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Power and machinery, money and goods, are useful only as they set us free to live. They are but means to an end. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=18">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ideas are of themselves extraordinarily valuable, but an idea is just an idea. Almost any one can think up an idea. The thing that counts is developing it into a practical product. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=31">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am not a reformer. I think there is entirely too much attempt at reforming in the world and that we pay too much attention to reformers. We have two kinds of reformers. Both are nuisances. The man who calls himself a reformer wants to smash things. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=39">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Freedom is the right to work a decent length of time and to get a decent living for doing so; to be able to arrange the little personal details of one’s own life. It is the aggregate of these and many other items of freedom which makes up the great idealistic Freedom. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=55">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the other hand, we have a different kind of reformer who never calls himself one. He is singularly like the radical reformer. The radical has had no experience and does not want it. The other class of reformer has had plenty of experience but it does him no good. I refer to the reactionary—who will be surprised to find himself put in exactly the same class as the Bolshevist. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=65">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is possible to prevent the world from going forward, but it is not possible then to prevent it from going back—from decaying. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=71">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trouble is that reformers and reactionaries alike get away from the realities—from the primary functions. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=73">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reactionaries have frequently taken advantage of the recoil from such a period, and they have promised “the good old times”—which usually means the bad old abuses—and because they are perfectly void of vision they are sometimes regarded as “practical men.” <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=76">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The foundations of society are the men and means to grow things, to make things, and to carry things. As long as agriculture, manufacture, and transportation survive, the world can survive any economic or social change. As we serve our jobs we serve the world. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=82">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We may help the Government; the Government cannot help us. The slogan of “less government in business and more business in government” is a very good one, not mainly on account of business or government, but on account of the people. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=92">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>A man ought to be able to live on a scale commensurate with the service that he renders. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=139">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Monopoly is bad for business. Profiteering is bad for business. The lack of necessity to hustle is bad for business. Business is never as healthy as when, like a chicken, it must do a certain amount of scratching for what it gets. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=143">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Money chasing is not business. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=147">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is very easy, unless one keeps a plan thoroughly in mind, to get burdened with money and then, in an effort to make more money, to forget all about selling to the people what they want. Business on a money-making basis is most insecure. It is a touch-and-go affair, moving irregularly and rarely over a term of years amounting to much. It is the function of business to produce for consumption and not for money or speculation. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=147">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The producer depends for his prosperity upon serving the people. He may get by for a while serving himself, but if he does, it will be purely accidental, and when the people wake up to the fact that they are not being served, the end of that producer is in sight. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=152">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being greedy for money is the surest way not to get it, but when one serves for the sake of service—for the satisfaction of doing that which one believes to be right—then money abundantly takes care of itself. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=156">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Money comes naturally as the result of service. And it is absolutely necessary to have money. But we do not want to forget that the end of money is not ease but the opportunity to perform more service. In my mind nothing is more abhorrent than a life of ease. None of us has any right to ease. There is no place in civilization for the idler. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=158">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Real simplicity means that which gives the very best service and is the most convenient in use. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=168">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start with an article that suits and then study to find some way of eliminating the entirely useless parts. This applies to everything—a shoe, a dress, a house, a piece of machinery, a railroad, a steamship, an airplane. As we cut out useless parts and simplify necessary ones we also cut down the cost of making. This is simple logic, but oddly enough the ordinary process starts with a cheapening of the manufacturing instead of with a simplifying of the article. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=171">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lack of knowledge of what is going on and lack of knowledge of what the job really is and the best way of doing it are the reasons why farming is thought not to pay. Nothing could pay the way farming is conducted. The farmer follows luck and his forefathers. He does not know how economically to produce, and he does not know how to market. A manufacturer who knew how neither to produce nor to market would not long stay in business. That the farmer can stay on shows how wonderfully profitable farming can be. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=196">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rushing into manufacturing without being certain of the product is the unrecognized cause of many business failures. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=207">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do not believe in letting any good idea get by me, but I will not quickly decide whether an idea is good or bad. If an idea seems good or seems even to have possibilities, I believe in doing whatever is necessary to test out the idea from every angle. But testing out the idea is something very different from making a change in the car. Where most manufacturers find themselves quicker to make a change in the product than in the method of manufacturing—we follow exactly the opposite course. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=213">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The essence of my idea then is that waste and greed block the delivery of true service. Both waste and greed are unnecessary. Waste is due largely to not understanding what one does, or being careless in doing of it. Greed is merely a species of nearsightedness. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=237">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The institution that we have erected is performing a service. That is the only reason I have for talking about it. The principles of that service are these: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=242">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>1. An absence of fear of the future and of veneration for the past. One who fears the future, who fears failure, limits his activities. Failure is only the opportunity more intelligently to begin again.</strong> There is no disgrace in honest failure; there is disgrace in fearing to fail. What is past is useful only as it suggests ways and means for progress. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=243">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>2. A disregard of competition.</strong> Whoever does a thing best ought to be the one to do it. It is criminal to try to get business away from another man—criminal because one is then trying to lower for personal gain the condition of one’s fellow man—to rule by force instead of by intelligence. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=246">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>3. The putting of service before profit. Without a profit, business cannot extend. There is nothing inherently wrong about making a profit. Well-conducted business enterprise cannot fail to return a profit, but profit must and inevitably will come as a reward for good service. It cannot be the basis—it must be the result of service</strong>. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=248">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>4. Manufacturing is not buying low and selling high. It is the process of buying materials fairly and, with the smallest possible addition of cost, transforming those materials into a consumable product and giving it to the consumer.</strong> Gambling, speculating, and sharp dealing, tend only to clog this progression. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=250">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is an immense amount to be learned simply by tinkering with things. It is not possible to learn from books how everything is made—and a real mechanic ought to know how nearly everything is made. Machines are to a mechanic what books are to a writer. He gets ideas from them, and if he has any brains he will apply those ideas. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=288">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was nothing more that the big steam tractors and engines could teach me and I did not want to waste time on something that would lead nowhere. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=333">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That is the way with wise people—they are so wise and practical that they always know to a dot just why something cannot be done; they always know the limitations. That is why I never employ an expert in full bloom. If ever I wanted to kill opposition by unfair means I would endow the opposition with experts. They would have so much good advice that I could be sure they would do little work. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=343">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I cannot say that it was hard work. No work with interest is ever hard. I always am certain of results. They always come if you work hard enough. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=373">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>There was no “demand” for automobiles—there never is for a new article. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=431">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most surprising feature of business as it was conducted was the large attention given to finance and the small attention to service. That seemed to me to be reversing the natural process which is that the money should come as the result of work and not before the work. The second feature was the general indifference to better methods of manufacture as long as whatever was done got by and took the money. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=458">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My idea was then and still is that if a man did his work well, the price he would get for that work, the profits and all financial matters, would care for themselves and that a business ought to start small and build itself up and out of its earnings. If there are no earnings then that is a signal to the owner that he is wasting his time and does not belong in that business. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=470">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good business was not one that did good work and earned a fair profit. A good business was one that would give the opportunity for the floating of a large amount of stocks and bonds at high prices. It was the stocks and bonds, not the work, that mattered. I could not see how a new business or an old business could be expected to be able to charge into its product a great big bond interest and then sell the product at a fair price. I have never been able to see that. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=476">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Money is not worth a particular amount. As money it is not worth anything, for it will do nothing of itself. The only use of money is to buy tools to work with or the product of tools. Therefore money is worth what it will help you to produce or buy and no more. If a man thinks that his money will earn 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, he ought to place it where he can get that return, but money placed in a business is not a charge on the business—or, rather, should not be. It ceases to be money and becomes, or should become, an engine of production, and it is therefore worth what it produces—and not a fixed sum according to some scale that has no bearing upon the particular business in which the money has been placed. Any return should come after it has produced, not before. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=484">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A manufacturer is not through with his customer when a sale is completed. He has then only started with his customer. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=500">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That is the shortsighted salesman-on-commission attitude. If a salesman is paid only for what he sells, it is not to be expected that he is going to exert any great effort on a customer out of whom no more commission is to be made. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=504">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If to petrify is success all one has to do is to humour the lazy side of the mind but if to grow is success, then one must wake up anew every morning and keep awake all day. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=522">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life, as I see it, is not a location, but a journey. Even the man who most feels himself “settled” is not settled—he is probably sagging back. Everything is in flux, and was meant to be. Life flows. We may live at the same number of the street, but it is never the same man who lives there. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=525">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But it is not a bad thing to be a fool for righteousness’ sake. The best of it is that such fools usually live long enough to prove that they were not fools—or the work they have begun lives long enough to prove they were not foolish. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=540">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The man who has the largest capacity for work and thought is the man who is bound to succeed. I cannot pretend to say, because I do not know, whether the man who works always, who never leaves his business, who is absolutely intent upon getting ahead, and who therefore does get ahead—is happier than the man who keeps office hours, both for his brain and his hands. It is not necessary for any one to decide the question. A ten-horsepower engine will not pull as much as a twenty. The man who keeps brain office hours limits his horsepower. If he is satisfied to pull only the load that he has, well and good, that is his affair—but he must not complain if another who has increased his horsepower pulls more than he does. Leisure and work bring different results. If a man wants leisure and gets it—then he has no cause to complain. But he cannot have both leisure and the results of work. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=563">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Concretely, what I most realized about business in that year—and I have been learning more each year without finding it necessary to change my first conclusions—is this: (1) That finance is given a place ahead of work and therefore tends to kill the work and destroy the fundamental of service. (2) That thinking first of money instead of work brings on fear of failure and this fear blocks every avenue of business—it makes a man afraid of competition, of changing his methods, or of doing anything which might change his condition. (3) That the way is clear for any one who thinks first of service—of doing the work in the best possible way. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=569">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>Ask a hundred people how they want a particular article made. About eighty will not know; they will leave it to you. Fifteen will think that they must say something, while five will really have preferences and reasons. The ninety-five, made up of those who do not know and admit it and the fifteen who do not know but do not admit it, constitute the real market for any product. The five who want something special may or may not be able to pay the price for special work. If they have the price, they can get the work, but they constitute a special and limited market. Of the ninety-five perhaps ten or fifteen will pay a price for quality. Of those remaining, a number will buy solely on price and without regard to quality. Their numbers are thinning with each day. Buyers are learning how to buy. The majority will consider quality and buy the biggest dollar’s worth of quality. If, therefore, you discover what will give this 95 per cent. of people the best all-round service and then arrange to manufacture at the very highest quality and sell at the very lowest price, you will be meeting a demand which is so large that it may be called universal. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=580">Open in Kindle</a></p>

(4) An adequately equipped repair shop which has in it the right machinery for every necessary repair and adjustment. (5) Mechanics who are thoroughly familiar with the construction and operation of Ford cars. (6) A comprehensive bookkeeping system and a follow-up sales system, so that it may be instantly apparent what is the financial status of the various departments of his business, the condition and size of his stock, the present owners of cars, and the future prospects.

Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings a state of mind in which nothing is impossible.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now a business, in my way of thinking, is not a machine. It is a collection of people who are brought together to do work and not to write letters to one another. It is not necessary for any one department to know what any other department is doing. If a man is doing his work he will not have time to take up any other work. It is the business of those who plan the entire work to see that all of the departments are working properly toward the same end. It is not necessary to have meetings to establish good feeling between individuals or departments. It is not necessary for people to love each other in order to work together. Too much good fellowship may indeed be a very bad thing, for it may lead to one man trying to cover up the faults of another. That is bad for both men. When we are at work we ought to be at work. When we are at play we ought to be at play. There is no use trying to mix the two. The sole object ought to be to get the work done and to get paid for it. When the work is done, then the play can come, but not before. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=1128">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>And so the Ford factories and enterprises have no organization, no specific duties attaching to any position, no line of succession or of authority, very few titles, and no conferences.

<blockquote>
  <p>The work and the work alone controls us. That is one of the reasons why we have no titles. Most men can swing a job, but they are floored by a title. The effect of a title is very peculiar. It has been used too much as a sign of emancipation from work. It is almost equivalent to a badge bearing the legend: “This man has nothing to do but regard himself as important and all others as inferior.” <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=1152">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There used to be a lot of advice given to officials not to hide behind their titles. The very necessity for the advice showed a condition that needed more than advice to correct it.

A few may be legally necessary; a few may be useful in directing the public how to do business with the concern, but for the rest the best rule is simple: “Get rid of them.” <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=1165">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>Since we do not take a man on his past history, we do not refuse him because of his past history. I never met a man who was thoroughly bad. There is always some good in him—if he gets a chance. That is the reason we do not care in the least about a man’s antecedents—we do not hire a man’s history, we hire the man. If he has been in jail, that is no reason to say that he will be in jail again. I think, on the contrary, he is, if given a chance, very likely to make a special effort to keep out of jail. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=1173">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>Men will work with the idea of catching somebody’s eye; they will work with the idea that if they fail to get credit for what they have done, they might as well have done it badly or not have done it at all. Thus the work sometimes becomes a secondary consideration. The job in hand—the article in hand, the special kind of service in hand—turns out to be not the principal job. The main work becomes personal advancement—a platform from which to catch somebody’s eye. This habit of making the work secondary and the recognition primary is unfair to the work. It makes recognition and credit the real job. And this also has an unfortunate effect on the worker. It encourages a peculiar kind of ambition which is neither lovely nor productive. It produces the kind of man who imagines that by “standing in with the boss” he will get ahead. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=1185">Open in Kindle</a></p>

The man who contributes much should take away much. Therefore no element of charity is present in the paying of wages.

  <p>To teach a child to invest and use is better than to teach him to save. Most men who are laboriously saving a few dollars would do better to invest those few dollars—first in themselves, and then in some useful work. Eventually they would have more to save. Young men ought to invest rather than save. They ought to invest in themselves to increase creative value; after they have taken themselves to the peak of usefulness, then will be time enough to think of laying aside, as a fixed policy, a certain substantial share of income. You are not “saving” when you prevent yourself from becoming more productive. You are really taking away from your ultimate capital; you are reducing the value of one of nature’s investments. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=2301">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>Industry organized for service removes the need for philanthropy. Philanthropy, no matter how noble its motive, does not make for self-reliance. We must have self-reliance. A community is the better for being discontented, for being dissatisfied with what it has. I do not mean the petty, daily, nagging, gnawing sort of discontent, but a broad, courageous sort of discontent which believes that everything which is done can and ought to be eventually done better. Industry organized for service—and the workingman as well as the leader must serve—can pay wages sufficiently large to permit every family to be both self-reliant and self-supporting. A philanthropy that spends its time and money in helping the world to do more for itself is far better than the sort which merely gives and thus encourages idleness. Philanthropy, like everything else, ought to be productive, and I believe that it can be. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=2580">Open in Kindle</a></p>

We need a kind of “universal training” in economic facts. The over-reaching ambitions of speculative capital, as well as the unreasonable demands of irresponsible labour, are due to ignorance of the economic basis of life. Nobody can get more out of life than life can produce—yet nearly everybody thinks he can. Speculative capital wants more; labour wants more; the source of raw material wants more; and the purchasing public wants more. A family knows that it cannot live beyond its income; even the children know that.

  <p>In clearing out the need for charity we must keep in mind not only the economic facts of existence, but also that lack of knowledge of these facts encourages fear. Banish fear and we can have self-reliance. Charity is not present where self-reliance dwells. Fear is the offspring of a reliance placed on something outside—on a foreman’s good-will, perhaps, on a shop’s prosperity, on a market’s steadiness. That is just another way of saying that fear is the portion of the man who acknowledges his career to be in the keeping of earthly circumstances. Fear is the result of the body assuming ascendancy over the soul. The habit of failure is purely mental and is the mother of fear. This habit gets itself fixed on men because they lack vision. They start out to do something that reaches from A to Z. At A they fail, at B they stumble, and at C they meet with what seems to be an insuperable difficulty. They then cry “Beaten” and throw the whole task down. They have not even given themselves a chance really to fail; they have not given their vision a chance to be proved or disproved.

An educated man is not one whose memory is trained to carry a few dates in history—he is one who can accomplish things. A man who cannot think is not an educated man however many college degrees he may have acquired. Thinking is the hardest work any one can do—which is probably the reason why we have so few thinkers. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=3040">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>You cannot learn in any school what the world is going to do next year, but you can learn some of the things which the world has tried to do in former years, and where it failed and where it succeeded. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=3045">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>But the best that education can do for a man is to put him in possession of his powers, give him control of the tools with which destiny has endowed him, and teach him how to think. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=3053">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may fill your head with all the “facts” of all the ages, and your head may be just an overloaded fact-box when you get through. The point is this: Great piles of knowledge in the head are not the same as mental activity. A man may be very learned and very useless. And then again, a man may be unlearned and very useful. The object of education is not to fill a man’s mind with facts; it is to teach him how to use his mind in thinking. And it often happens that a man can think better if he is not hampered by the knowledge of the past. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=3066">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Merely gathering knowledge may become the most useless work a man can do. What can you do to help and heal the world? That is the educational test. If a man can hold up his own end, he counts for one. If he can help ten or a hundred or a thousand other men hold up their ends, he counts for more. He may be quite rusty on many things that inhabit the realm of print, but he is a learned man just the same. When a man is master of his own sphere, whatever it may be, he has won his degree—he has entered the realm of wisdom. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=3074">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>The exploitation of dissatisfaction is an established business to-day. Its object is not to settle anything, nor to get anything done, but to keep dissatisfaction in existence. And the instruments used to do this are a whole set of false theories and promises which can never be fulfilled as long as the earth remains what it is. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=3158">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <p>The business of life is easy or hard according to the skill or the lack of skill displayed in production and distribution. It has been thought that business existed for profit. That is wrong. Business exists for service. It is a profession, and must have recognized professional ethics, to violate which declasses a man. Business needs more of the professional spirit. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B0084AMXOY&amp;location=3315">Open in Kindle</a></p>
