<blockquote>
  <p><em>The other part of this communication consists of receiving the same four pieces of information from others. We connect with them by first sensing what they are observing, feeling, and needing; then we discover what would enrich their lives by receiving the fourth piece—their request. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=421">Read more</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Moralistic Judgments One kind of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who don’t act in harmony with our values. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=540">Read more</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is my belief that all such analyses of other human beings are tragic expressions of our own values and needs. They are tragic because when we express our values and needs in this form, we increase defensiveness and resistance among the very people whose behaviors are of concern to us. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=560">Read more</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It is important here not to confuse value judgments and moralistic judgments. All of us make value judgments as to the qualities we value in life; for example, we might value honesty, freedom, or peace. Value judgments reflect our beliefs of how life can best be served. We make moralistic judgments of people and behaviors that fail to support our value judgments; for example, “Violence is bad. People who kill others are evil.” <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=568">Read more</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>For example, instead of “Violence is bad,” we might say instead, “I am fearful of the use of violence to resolve conflicts; I value the resolution of human conflicts through other means.” <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=573">Read more</a></em></p>

  <p><em>the more people are trained to think in terms of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness and badness, the more they are being trained to look outside themselves—to outside authorities—for the definition of what constitutes right, wrong, good, and bad.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Summary It is our nature to enjoy giving and receiving compassionately. We have, however, learned many forms of life-alienating communication that lead us to speak and behave in ways that injure others and ourselves. One form of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of those who don’t act in harmony with our values. Another is the use of comparisons, which can block compassion both for others and for ourselves. Life-alienating communication also obscures our awareness that we are each responsible for our own thoughts, feelings, and actions. Communicating our desires in the form of demands is yet another characteristic of language that blocks compassion. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=678">Read more</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our requests are received as demands when others believe they will be blamed or punished if they do not comply. When people hear a demand, they see only two options: submission or rebellion.

  <p><strong>NVC suggests that our paraphrasing take the form of questions that reveal our understanding while eliciting any necessary corrections from the speaker</strong>. Questions may focus on these components: what others are observing: “Are you reacting to how many evenings I was gone last week?” how others are feeling and the needs generating their feelings: “Are you feeling hurt because you would have liked more appreciation of your efforts than you received?” what others are requesting: “Are you wanting me to tell you my reasons for saying what I did?” <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=1913">Open in Kindle</a></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we paraphrase, the tone of voice we use is highly important. When hearing themselves reflected back, people are likely to be sensitive to the slightest hint of criticism or sarcasm. They are likewise negatively affected by a declarative tone that implies that we are telling them what is going on inside of them. <strong>If we are consciously listening for other people’s feelings and needs, however, our tone communicates that we’re asking whether we have understood—not claiming that we have understood.</strong> <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=1963">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>all criticism, attack, insults, and judgments vanish when we focus attention on hearing the feelings and needs behind a message.</strong> The more we practice in this way, the more we realize a simple truth: behind all those messages we’ve allowed ourselves to be intimidated by are just individuals with unmet needs appealing to us to contribute to their well-being. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=1969">Open in Kindle</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NVC’s most important use may be in developing self-compassion. We use NVC to evaluate ourselves in ways that engender growth rather than self-hatred.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In our language there is a word with enormous power to create shame and guilt. This violent word, which we commonly use to evaluate ourselves, is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness that many of us would have trouble imagining how to live without it. It is the word should, as in “I should have known better” or “I shouldn’t have done that.” Most of the time when we use this word with ourselves, we resist learning, because should implies that there is no choice. Human beings, when hearing any kind of demand, tend to resist because it threatens our autonomy—our strong need for choice. We have this reaction to tyranny even when it’s internal tyranny in the form of a should. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=2420">Open in Kindle</a></p>

  <li><strong>(4) TO AVOID SHAME</strong> There may be some tasks we choose to do just to avoid shame. We know that if we don’t do them, we’ll end up suffering severe self-judgment, hearing our own voice telling us there is something wrong or stupid about us. If we do something stimulated solely by the urge to avoid shame, we will generally end up detesting it. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=2553">Open in Kindle</a></li>
  <li><strong>(5) TO AVOID GUILT</strong> In other instances, we may think, “If I don’t do this, people will be disappointed in me.” We are afraid we’ll end up feeling guilty for failing to fulfill other people’s expectations of us. There is a world of difference between doing something for others in order to avoid guilt and doing it out of a clear awareness of our own need to contribute to the happiness of other human beings. The first is a world filled with misery; the second is a world filled with play. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=2556">Open in Kindle</a></li>
  <li><strong>(6) TO SATISFY A SENSE OF DUTY</strong> When we use language which denies choice (for example, words such as should, have to, ought, must, can’t, supposed to, etc.), our behaviors arise out of a vague sense of guilt, duty, or obligation. I consider this to be the most socially dangerous and personally unfortunate of all the ways we act when we’re cut off from our needs. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=2562">Open in Kindle</a></li>

  <p>The first step to fully expressing anger in NVC is to <strong>divorce the other person from any responsibility for our anger</strong>.

  <p>For those of you wishing to apply NVC, especially in challenging situations of anger, I would suggest the following exercise.

  <p><strong>resolving conflicts involves all the principles I outlined previously in this book:</strong> <strong>observing, identifying and expressing feelings, connecting feelings with needs, and making doable requests of another person using clear, concrete, positive action language.</strong> <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=2908">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The parties also need to know from the start that the objective is not to get the other side to do what they want them to do.

  <p>Fundamentally, needs are the resources life requires to sustain itself. We all have physical needs: air, water, food, rest.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In a conflict, both parties usually spend too much time intent on proving themselves right, and the other party wrong, rather than paying attention to their own and the other’s needs.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order not to confuse needs and strategies, it is important to recall that needs contain no reference to anybody taking any particular action.

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of expressing needs, they were doing analysis, which is easily heard as criticism by a listener.

<blockquote>
  <p>So this is our work: learning to recognize the need in statements that don’t overtly express any need. It takes practice, and it always involves some guessing.

<blockquote>
  <p>A present language statement refers to what is wanted at this moment. For example, one party might say, “I’d like you to tell me if you would be willing to—” and describe the action they’d like the other party to take. The use of a present language request that begins with “Would you be willing to …” helps foster a respectful discussion. If the other side answers that they are not willing, it invites the next step of understanding what prevents their willingness. On the other hand, in the absence of present language, a request such as “I’d like you to go to the show with me Saturday night” fails to convey what’s being asked of the listener at that moment. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=3087">Open in Kindle</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can further clarify the request by indicating what we may want from the other person in the present moment, “Would you be willing to tell me how you feel about going to the show with me Saturday night?” The clearer we are regarding the response we want right now from the other party, the more effectively we move the conflict toward resolution. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=3094">Open in Kindle</a></p>

What action or decision would I request this person to take in the belief that it would enable them to live more happily?” Because our responses to these questions would reveal a lot about ourselves and our values, we would feel far more vulnerable than if we were to simply diagnose the other person. <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B014OISVU4&amp;location=3553">Open in Kindle</a></p>
