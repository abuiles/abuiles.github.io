I've been reading a book titled "How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life" by Russell Roberts ([@econtalker](https://twitter.com/econtalker)). I thought this book was going to be a mix of philosophy and Smith's "The Wealth of Nations" but I was wrong.

Russell covers a less known book by Smith called "The Theory of Moral Sentiments", in which Smith tries to answer more existencial questions like how to be happy or make the world a better place.

I want to leave you with the following recipe from the book to make the world a better place.

>If you want to make the world a better place, work on being trustworthy, and honor those who are trustworthy. Be a good friend and surround yourself with worthy friends. Don’t gossip. Resist the joke that might hurt someone’s feelings even when it’s clever. And try not to laugh when your friend tells you that clever joke at someone’s expense. Being good is not just good for you and those around you, but because it helps others be good as well. Set a good example, and by your loveliness you will not only be loved, but you may influence the world.

If you are interested in Stoicism, being a good person and living a good life, then I recommend this book, it will teach you one thing or two about life: [How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life: An Unexpected Guide to Human Nature and Happiness](https://www.amazon.com/Adam-Smith-Change-Your-Life-ebook/dp/B00INIXQA2)
