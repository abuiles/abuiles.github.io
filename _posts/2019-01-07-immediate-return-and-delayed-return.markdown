Yesterday while reading [Atomic
Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) I came across two new
concepts which are called `immediate return` and `delayed return`
environments.

We are under `immediate return` when focused on the results which can
be received instantly. Our ancestor who used to wander in the African
Savannah use to exist on an immediate results environments. Since they
didn't know when was the next time they could secure a meal, take
shelter or not get devoured by lions, it made sense for them to place
value in instant gratification.

Current society lives on a `delayed return environment`, most of our
actions tend to pay-off in the long term. We invest time learning
something to eventually get our dream job. We put money in our pension
fund so that we can retire one day.

In the context of habits, our bias towards instant gratification can
cause problems when trying to create new habits. Who doesn't prefer
those extra 30 minutes of sleep at 5:30 a.m instead of hitting the
gym.
