I stopped writing my series of getting started with Ember.js using
Ember AppKit Rails after finding out that the gem was doomed to die in
favor of using ember-cli. Brian Cardarella [wrote](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/05/04/stop-using-ember-appkit-rails.html) recently about the
reasons behind.

During the last months I've been following ember-cli and using it to
migrate the app which I was building as part of the series for then
writing about it, but Brian released recently a series of post about
using ember-cli with Rails which are really good:

  1. [Building an Ember App with Rails Part 1.](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/05/07/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-1.html)
  2. [Building an Ember App with Rails Part 2.](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/05/08/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-2.html)
  3. [Building an Ember App with Rails Part 2.](http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/05/09/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-part-3.html)

I still plan to continue writing about it since there is room for a
lot of stuff and the ember-cli project is moving fast, but for now I
would recommend Brian's posts and as he said, just stopped using EAKR,
ember-cli is the future and building apps with it is a lot of
fun.

If you are interested in migrating an app from Rails to ember-cli the
following are the commits since I started the migration [https://github.com/abuiles/facturas/compare/b47781f...master](https://github.com/abuiles/facturas/compare/b47781f...master).
