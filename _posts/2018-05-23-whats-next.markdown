I left my job at Envoy without any specific plans in mind. I wanted
time off to take care of personal stuff and then figure what to do
next.

Without planning it, I launched AnclaX as an experiment on
creating a Stellar anchor in Colombia. People started to sign-up and
they were trading with their Colombian Pesos (COP) and Lumens (XLM).

After giving it a lot of thought and considering some legal stuff, I
decided to discard the original idea of building an anchor to give
access to people to the Stellar distributed exchange.

A problem that has been in my mind for a long time is how to create a
financial system which is more inclusive, it's expensive to be poor<sup>1</sup>. Making it easy for people to
speculate, is not going to help that poor person in Colombia paying
over 300% in interest rate to loan sharks.

So what's next? And what is AnclaX? I'm still discovering the answer
to those questions. For now I have some hypothesis which I'm validating
against the market.

The @StellarOrg bio on twitter says:

> Stellar is a free, open-source network that lets anyone build low-cost financial products for their community.

AnclaX is a layer of top of Stellar. I've been building
infrastructure and software to make it easier for companies,
communities, co-ops and SMBs to take advantage of what Stellar
offers without having to worry about the technical details.

I believe that if I can build products and infrastructure which are
affordable, I'll be able to pass that benefit to the end user and
ultimately help more people start building their financial footprint.

Until this week I was in negotiations with two "big" co-ops in
Colombia, one with over 1M associates and the other one with over 10K
associates, but unfortunately we couldn't make things work<sup>2</sup>. The fact
that I got to a late stage in both processes, gives me some hope and
is a signal that I might be onto something.

I still don't know exactly what is next, but I'll
continue experimenting until I run out of money<sup>3</sup> or decide
that maybe this isn't a good idea, after all I need to find a model
where I can make a living and can afford to pay others.

<sup>2</sup> This is the first time I build something for the Colombian market, a friend used to say that it was horrible to sell a B2B SaaS in Colombia, I'm starting to understand why, but that's material for a post on its own.
