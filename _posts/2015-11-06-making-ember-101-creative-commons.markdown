Over a year ago I started to work on a book then called
[ember-cli-101](https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101). This was a crazy experiment on my end, I didn't have
any writing experience, started to sell the book without finishing it,
and committed to keep it up to date with the latest Ember version.

With almost 3000 readers today, the book was a total success, people
loved it and it helped them to get started with Ember which was my main
goal.

Today I want to make a stronger commitment with the Ember community
and make my book accessible to everyone. To achieve this I'm dropping
the price on leanpub to $0, so money won't be a problem if you want to
learn Ember, while still allowing other people to pay whatever they
think is worth (I'm suggesting $9.99). Also, I'm renaming the book to
"ember-101" since it is not really a book about ember-cli but a book
about Ember.

Oh, and as I say it in the title, I'm releasing my book under a
creative commons license so everyone can suggest edits and together
craft the best book about Ember!

You can find the source code of the book here [https://github.com/abuiles/ember-101](https://github.com/abuiles/ember-101) and download it from leanpub [https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101](https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101).

I want to thank everyone who bought the book, without you I wouldn't
be able to do this. **Thanks for helping me spread the Ember love around the world!**
