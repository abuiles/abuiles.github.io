My favorite engineering team out there is probably Artsy. If you go
through their blog you might understand why. One of their core mantras
is "Open Source by Default".

I've given a lot of thought to that idea. In the past, I tried to
apply it with no success to the companies I was working with.

My history with open source dates back to 2007, and then in 2010 I had
the opportunity to participate in the Google Summer of Code, following
my work around Ember.js ecosystem, making creative commons my
book "Ember 101" and then a long break until today.

Now that I'm experimenting with something new and have the power to
decide, I've been thinking of making AnclaX open source by default
too.

I want to publish everything under the MIT license and
optionally offer a "Pro" version of AnclaX which would be managed. The
idea of the pro version is inspired by Ghost, the publishing platform.

As I mentioned in [What's next?](/blog/2018/05/23/whats-next/), I feel
identified with Stellar and their goal of "connecting people to
low-cost financial services to fight poverty and develop individual
potential".

Making all my work open-source might be a step towards that goal. Some
people might have the money to pay for the pro version while others
might not have it but still be able to benefit from all the work that
I'm doing open source.

I'll try to keep you posted on this experiment and if you have worked on
a company which is open source by default or have thoughts about this,
I'd love to hear your comments.
