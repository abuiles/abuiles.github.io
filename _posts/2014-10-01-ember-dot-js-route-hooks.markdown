As part of my Ember.js Coaching business, I explain very often to
people how the Ember Route hooks work and the kind of stuff they can
do with them, a question that always pops up is: **But in which order
are they called?**.

To answer this I use an awesome JSBin created by [Robert
Jackson (@rwjblue)](https://twitter.com/rwjblue) which shows exactly the order in which the hooks are called, I find myself looking at this from time to time and always find it super useful so I hope you do too, enjoy!

Don't forget to thank Robert (@rwjblue) for this!
