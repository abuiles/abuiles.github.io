&lt;p&gt;Using Cal Newport’s definition, I’ve been interested in finding and developing strategies that allow me to do “Deep Work” which he defines as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free
concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their
limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill and are hard
to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2RUfAQ5&quot;&gt;Newport, Cal. Deep Work (p. 3). Grand Central Publishing. Kindle Edition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our private, social, and work lives are full of distractions. Anyone can hijack our attention easily. At work, the growth of Slack and the culture of constant connectivity is making it difficult for people to focus on a task without getting interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we do about this, and how can we find spaces for Deep Work? If you read Cal’s book, he includes some answers to this question. I want to write here about specific hacks I’ve been doing that have helped me find space to do Deep Work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hack-1-turn-on-do-not-disturb&quot;&gt;Hack #1: Turn-on Do not disturb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to keep my phone and computer on “Do not disturb” mode. It keeps all the notifications away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;org14666ae&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hack-2-turn-off-the-internet-on-the-phone&quot;&gt;Hack #2: Turn off the Internet on the phone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hack protects me from myself, I’ve noticed that sometimes I grab my phone automatically without any specific goal, turning off the internet keeps me away from completing any other action. The interesting thing here is that before turning on the internet, I reconsider what I am about to do, leading to just putting my phone down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;orgbc36361&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hack-3-signout-from-social-networks-and-make-it-difficult-to-get-in&quot;&gt;Hack #3: Signout from social networks and make it difficult to get in&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit Facebook a couple of years ago, but I still keep a Twitter account. Now my strategy for protecting myself from Twitter is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always signout after using it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn-on two-factor auth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, I use a yubico security key for social media, which I keep away from me. If I want to open Twitter, it forces me to think if I want to stand up and grab my key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hack-4-signout-from-email&quot;&gt;Hack #4: Signout from email&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work doesn’t require me to be on top of email, and I can decide how to react to my personal email. That’s why I try to keep my email logged out as well. If I go to my inbox, then I won’t see anything because it will ask me to log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hack-5-use-multiple-profiles-in-the-browser&quot;&gt;Hack #5: Use multiple profiles in the browser&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern browsers have a cool feature called profiles. I have a personal profile, a work profile, and a dev profile. Profiles, combined with &lt;a href=&quot;#orgbc36361&quot;&gt;hack #3&lt;/a&gt;, allow me to stay logged out from distracting websites or websites that I frequently visit on idle time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hack-6-use-freedomto-or-rescuetime&quot;&gt;Hack #6: Use freedom.to or rescuetime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used both tools for several years. Sometimes it can be kind of depressing to see how you spend your time, but the more you use this kind of tool and the more intentional you are about your relationship with the internet, the better it gets. Both apps have even more extreme features like actually blocking a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hack-7-no-coworking-spaces&quot;&gt;Hack #7: No coworking spaces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is more personal, but I find it very difficult to concentrate when working on an open space floor or with people having calls next to me all the time. I recently moved back to a home office, and it’s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hack-8-develop-rituals&quot;&gt;Hack #8: Develop rituals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a set of rituals that I follow every day; they help me get into the mode and prepare for focusing on my work or whatever I’m trying to do. For example, I tend to block a full hour after breakfast for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;margin: 0 0 1rem 0;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding space for deep work is getting more challenging, however, it’s not a lost battle, and there are multiple things that we can do to help our mind push its cognitive capabilities. The hacks above work well for me, but they are not written in stone; I’m always experimenting and adjusting as I see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about other methods and learning more about deep work, I’d recommend reading Cal Newport’s book: &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2RUfAQ5&quot;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, I’d also love to learn from you and the different strategies you have used to achieve the same.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve always been interested in personal productivity, habits building, and how to foster spaces that allow me to think and work free from distractions.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Immediate and Delayed Return environments</title><link href="https://blog.abuiles.com/blog/2019/01/07/immediate-return-and-delayed-return/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Immediate and Delayed Return environments" /><published>2019-01-07T09:37:22-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-07T09:37:22-05:00</updated><id>https://blog.abuiles.com/blog/2019/01/07/immediate-return-and-delayed-return</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.abuiles.com/blog/2019/01/07/immediate-return-and-delayed-return/">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday while reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits&quot;&gt;Atomic
Habits&lt;/a&gt; I came across two new
concepts which are called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;immediate return&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delayed return&lt;/code&gt;
environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;immediate return&lt;/code&gt; when focused on the results which can
be received instantly. Our ancestor who used to wander in the African
Savannah use to exist on an immediate results environments. Since they
didn’t know when was the next time they could secure a meal, take
shelter or not get devoured by lions, it made sense for them to place
value in instant gratification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current society lives on a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delayed return environment&lt;/code&gt;, most of our
actions tend to pay-off in the long term. We invest time learning
something to eventually get our dream job. We put money in our pension
fund so that we can retire one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of habits, our bias towards instant gratification can
cause problems when trying to create new habits. Who doesn’t prefer
those extra 30 minutes of sleep at 5:30 a.m instead of hitting the
gym.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Yesterday while reading Atomic Habits I came across two new concepts which are called immediate return and delayed return environments.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Building Your Own Venmo With Stellar</title><link href="https://blog.abuiles.com/blog/2018/06/15/building-your-own-venmo-with-stellar/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Building Your Own Venmo With Stellar" /><published>2018-06-15T13:30:05-05:00</published><updated>2018-06-15T13:30:05-05:00</updated><id>https://blog.abuiles.com/blog/2018/06/15/building-your-own-venmo-with-stellar</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.abuiles.com/blog/2018/06/15/building-your-own-venmo-with-stellar/">&lt;p&gt;I often chat with people in the Stellar Slack who want to build something similar to Venmo and they tend to struggle understanding how different concepts apply for what they are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/05/28/open-source-by-default/&quot;&gt;“open source by default?”&lt;/a&gt;, I was thinking about open sourcing the backend components which I built for &lt;a href=&quot;http://anclax.com/&quot;&gt;AnclaX&lt;/a&gt;. After giving it some thought, I decided that instead of just putting a bunch of repos in the wild, I’m going to take a more structure approach to it. I’ll be writing a mini-book called “Building Your Own Venmo With Stellar” where I’ll be introducing concepts and building components bit by bit. Unlike my previous books/tutorials, this one will be completely free from the beginning and I’ll leave the doors open for XLM tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To goal with this resource will be to create a product “similar” to Venmo using Stellar. By the end of the series people should have a better grasp on what’s required to build things on top of Stellar and hopefully have an open source wallet and server which they can use to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be following a similar approach to what I did with &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/ember-cli-101&quot;&gt;Ember 101&lt;/a&gt;, which was making everything available from the beginning - readers will be able to follow through as I write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tutorial will be published in the following URL &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.abuiles.com/building-your-own-venmo-with-stellar/&quot;&gt;https://blog.abuiles.com/building-your-own-venmo-with-stellar/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I often chat with people in the Stellar Slack who want to build something similar to Venmo and they tend to struggle understanding how different concepts apply for what they are trying to do.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Open Source by Default?</title><link href="https://blog.abuiles.com/blog/2018/05/28/open-source-by-default/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Open Source by Default?" /><published>2018-05-28T19:26:33-05:00</published><updated>2018-05-28T19:26:33-05:00</updated><id>https://blog.abuiles.com/blog/2018/05/28/open-source-by-default</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.abuiles.com/blog/2018/05/28/open-source-by-default/">&lt;p&gt;My favorite engineering team out there is probably Artsy. If you go
through their blog you might understand why. One of their core mantras
is “Open Source by Default”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve given a lot of thought to that idea. In the past, I tried to
apply it with no success to the companies I was working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My history with open source dates back to 2007, and then in 2010 I had
the opportunity to participate in the Google Summer of Code, following
my work around Ember.js ecosystem, making creative commons my
book “Ember 101” and then a long break until today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m experimenting with something new and have the power to
decide, I’ve been thinking of making AnclaX open source by default
too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to publish everything under the MIT license and
optionally offer a “Pro” version of AnclaX which would be managed. The
idea of the pro version is inspired by Ghost, the publishing platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2018/05/23/whats-next/&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/a&gt;, I feel
identified with Stellar and their goal of “connecting people to
low-cost financial services to fight poverty and develop individual
potential”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making all my work open-source might be a step towards that goal. Some
people might have the money to pay for the pro version while others
might not have it but still be able to benefit from all the work that
I’m doing open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to keep you posted on this experiment and if you have worked on
a company which is open source by default or have thoughts about this,
I’d love to hear your comments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My favorite engineering team out there is probably Artsy.

I wanted
time off to take care of personal stuff and then figure what to do
next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As you start to walk out on the path, the path appears. // Rumi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without planning it, I launched AnclaX as an experiment on
creating a Stellar anchor in Colombia. People started to sign-up and
they were trading with their Colombian Pesos (COP) and Lumens (XLM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After giving it a lot of thought and considering some legal stuff, I
decided to discard the original idea of building an anchor to give
access to people to the Stellar distributed exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A problem that has been in my mind for a long time is how to create a
financial system which is more inclusive, it’s expensive to be poor&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Making it easy for people to
speculate, is not going to help that poor person in Colombia paying
over 300% in interest rate to loan sharks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s next? And what is AnclaX? I’m still discovering the answer
to those questions. For now I have some hypothesis which I’m validating
against the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The @StellarOrg bio on twitter says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Stellar is a free, open-source network that lets anyone build low-cost financial products for their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AnclaX is a layer of top of Stellar. I’ve been building
infrastructure and software to make it easier for companies,
communities, co-ops and SMBs to take advantage of what Stellar
offers without having to worry about the technical details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that if I can build products and infrastructure which are
affordable, I’ll be able to pass that benefit to the end user and
ultimately help more people start building their financial footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this week I was in negotiations with two “big” co-ops in
Colombia, one with over 1M associates and the other one with over 10K
associates, but unfortunately we couldn’t make things work&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The fact
that I got to a late stage in both processes, gives me some hope and
is a signal that I might be onto something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don’t know exactly what is next, but I’ll
continue experimenting until I run out of money&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or decide
that maybe this isn’t a good idea, after all I need to find a model
where I can make a living and can afford to pay others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This is the first time I build something for the Colombian market, a friend used to say that it was horrible to sell a B2B SaaS in Colombia, I’m starting to understand why, but that’s material for a post on its own.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; I have some savings which help me go without requiring external funding and then thanks to the Stellar Build Challenge I got a price which is helping to pay for lawyers and some contractors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I left my job at Envoy without any specific plans in mind.

I thought this book was going to be a mix of philosophy and Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations” but I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russell covers a less known book by Smith called “The Theory of Moral Sentiments”, in which Smith tries to answer more existencial questions like how to be happy or make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to leave you with the following recipe from the book to make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you want to make the world a better place, work on being trustworthy, and honor those who are trustworthy. Be a good friend and surround yourself with worthy friends. Don’t gossip. Resist the joke that might hurt someone’s feelings even when it’s clever. And try not to laugh when your friend tells you that clever joke at someone’s expense. Being good is not just good for you and those around you, but because it helps others be good as well. Set a good example, and by your loveliness you will not only be loved, but you may influence the world. &lt;a href=&quot;kindle://book?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B00INIXQA2&amp;amp;location=1833&quot;&gt;How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life - Russell Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking forward to read this book after watching a TED talk [1] by the author where he talks about slow hunches and the commonplace book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we ask “Where good ideas come from?” there is a common believe they are born out of eureka moments, but the author give us a more descriptive answer to this question suggesting that eureka moments rarely exist and there isn’t a single source of ideas but rather there are a series of shared patterns and properties that recur to generate different kinds of innovations. The author calls those patterns the 7 patterns of innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a book about the space of innovation. Some environments squelch new ideas; some environments seem to breed them effortlessly … The argument of this book is that a series of shared properties and patterns recur again and again in unusually fertile environments … The more we embrace these patterns—in our private work habits and hobbies, in our office environments, in the design of new software tools—the better we will be at tapping our extraordinary capacity for innovative thinking.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author gives us a broad historical outlook on how some ideas where born and then introduce each of his patterns and how they made that idea possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZK58TA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B003ZK58TA&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=abuiles0c-20&quot;&gt;Buy on amazon to follow along my highlights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pattern-1-the-adjacent-possible&quot;&gt;Pattern 1: THE ADJACENT POSSIBLE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pattern introduced by Steven is called “the adjacent possible&lt;strong&gt;”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What the adjacent possible tells us is that at any moment the world is capable of extraordinary change, but only certain changes can happen.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term was coined by the scientist Stuart Kauffman to explain biological innovation but Steven uses it to show us how it can be used for ideas too. Anyone might be able to come up with extraordinary ideas but in order for them to succeed a previous set of ideas or innovations have to pre-exist. The adjacent possible are those openings that unlock as we create new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great way to see the adjacent possible in action is to think of any web service that we use and then start going backwards. Let’s use Uber as an example, someone in the 60’s might have think of a device to order a taxi, but was it possible to do build that back then? No. That’s an idea which was “ahead of its time’. In order for Uber to exist, there were many doors that had to be unlocked - to list a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Global Positioning System.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Credit Cards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list can go on and on, building Uber was not just sheer luck but rather a combination of ideas that were there waiting for someone to bring them together and unlock a new door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When talking about technology, I think Amazon Web Services was one of the biggest rooms with unlocked doors. Many services could be built because of them, and then those services contribute to the creation of more ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pattern-2-liquid-networks&quot;&gt;Pattern 2: LIQUID NETWORKS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second pattern is “liquid networks”. Steven writes on how the social flow of group conversations help ideas to connects. In the book the author shows through numerous examples how cities, the eighteenth-century English coffeehouse or the first market towns in Italy ended up being great places for new ideas to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dunbar’s research suggests one vaguely reassuring thought: even with all the advanced technology of a leading molecular biology lab, the most productive tool for generating good ideas remains a circle of humans at a table, talking shop. The lab meeting creates an environment where new combinations can occur, where information can spill over from one project to another.** When you work alone in an office, peering into a microscope, your ideas can get trapped in place, stuck in your own initial biases. The social flow of the group conversation turns that private solid state into a liquid network**.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the first market towns emerged in Italy, they didn’t magically create some higher-level group consciousness. They simply widened the pool of minds that could come up with and share good ideas. This is not the wisdom of the crowd, but the wisdom of someone in the crowd. &lt;strong&gt;It’s not that the network itself is smart; it’s that the individuals get smarter because they’re connected to the network.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And so, most great ideas first take shape in a partial, incomplete form. They have the seeds of something profound, but they lack a key element that can turn the hunch into something truly powerful. And more often than not, that missing element is somewhere else, living as another hunch in another person’s head. &lt;strong&gt;Liquid networks create an environment where those partial ideas can connect; they provide a kind of dating service for promising hunches. They make it easier to disseminate good ideas, of course, but they also do something more sublime: they help complete ideas.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pattern-3-the-slow-hunch&quot;&gt;Pattern 3: THE SLOW HUNCH&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of my favorite chapters, not only because of the stories behind but because this is highly related with one of my side-projects: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kintrospect.com&quot;&gt;Kintrospect&lt;/a&gt;. The author uses the term slow hunch to show us how great ideas come into the world more as hunches than revelations, and then introduces the commonplace book as a secret to cultivate hunches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin, Milton, Bacon, Locke and Erasmus – they were some of the great thinkers mentioned in the chapter and how keeping a commonplace book help them reflect on their previous hunches to come up with new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And so, most great ideas first take shape in a partial, incomplete form.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Darwin’s notebooks lie at the tail end of a long and fruitful tradition that peaked in Enlightenment-era Europe, particularly in England: the practice of maintaining a “commonplace” book. Scholars, amateur scientists, aspiring men of letters—just about anyone with intellectual ambition in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was likely to keep a commonplace book. The great minds of the period—Milton, Bacon, Locke—were zealous believers in the memory-enhancing powers of the commonplace book. In its most customary form, “commonplacing,” as it was called, involved transcribing interesting or inspirational passages from one’s reading, assembling a personalized encyclopedia of quotations. There is a distinct self-help quality to the early descriptions of commonplacing’s virtues: maintaining the books enabled one to “lay up a fund of knowledge, from which we may at all times select what is useful in the several pursuits of life.”

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So part of the secret of hunch cultivation is simple: write everything down.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pattern-4-serendipity&quot;&gt;Pattern 4: SERENDIPITY&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth chapter talks about the creation of new ideas thanks to accidental connections. Serendipity is the world to describe such accidents. We have slow hunches in our minds, things we have taken or given to liquid networks and a world full of adjacent possibles, sometimes what we then need is just some neurons to fire at the same time to bring ideas to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But serendipity is not just about embracing random encounters for the sheer exhilaration of it. Serendipity is built out of happy accidents, to be sure, but what makes them happy is the fact that the discovery you’ve made is meaningful to you. It completes a hunch, or opens up a door in the adjacent possible that you had overlooked.
&lt;a href=&quot;kindle://book?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B003ZK58TA&amp;amp;location=1214&quot;&gt;Johnson, Steven. Where Good Ideas Come From - Open in Kindle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author describes possible ways to cultivate serendipity like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Google and Wikipedia give those passing hints something to attach to, a kind of information anchor that lets you settle down around a topic and explore the surrounding area. They turn hints and happy accidents into information. &lt;strong&gt;If the commonplace book tradition tells us that the best way to nurture hunches is to write everything down, the serendipity engine of the Web suggests a parallel directive: look everything up.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;kindle://book?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B003ZK58TA&amp;amp;location=1402&quot;&gt;Johnson, Steven. Where Good Ideas Come From - Open in Kindle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author touches on a very important subject and is the creation of walls around ideas, counter intuitive at what we have learned about the generation of new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The premise that innovation prospers when ideas can serendipitously connect and recombine with other ideas, when hunches can stumble across other hunches that successfully fill in their blanks, may seem like an obvious truth, but the strange fact is that a great deal of the past two centuries of legal and folk wisdom about innovation has pursued the exact opposite argument, building walls between ideas, keeping them from the kind of random, serendipitous connections that exist in dreams and in the organic compounds of life. Ironically, those walls have been erected with the explicit aim of encouraging innovation. **They go by many names: patents, digital rights management, intellectual property, trade secrets, proprietary technology. But they share a founding assumption: that in the long run, innovation will increase if you put restrictions on the spread of new ideas, because those restrictions will allow the creators to collect large financial rewards from their inventions. And those rewards will then attract other innovators to follow in their path&lt;/strong&gt; …**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By making the ideas public, and by ensuring that they remain stored in the database, these systems create an architecture for organizational serendipity. They give good ideas new ways to connect&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to mention here an article I read recently by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mgsiegler&quot;&gt;M.G. Siegler&lt;/a&gt; title “&lt;a href=&quot;https://500ish.com/the-age-of-abundance-9bc365913cba&quot;&gt;The Age of Abundance”&lt;/a&gt; where he argues how technology is leaving serendipity behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the move to perfection, we’ve left serendipity and randomness behind …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As Om puts it: The algorithmic world we live in puts convenience and speed ahead of these abstract concepts of human consciousness and connections. Facebook has blunted the idea of friendship, and relationships, LinkedIn has turned business relations into a spectator sport of likes, follows and recommendations. Algorithm writers forget that we all need narratives, stories we need to tell each other to have a real connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pattern-5-error&quot;&gt;Pattern 5: ERROR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter Steven shows us how the constant accumulation of error produces new ideas and like in other chapters, walk us through history to make his point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The invention of the Audion sounds like a classic story of ingenuity and persistence: a maverick inventor holed up in his bedroom lab notices a striking pattern and tinkers with it for years as a slow hunch, until he hits upon a contraption that changes the world. But telling the story that way misses one crucial fact: that at almost every step of the way, de Forest was flat-out wrong about what he was inventing. The Audion was not so much an invention as it was the steady, persistent accumulation of error.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A point that really caught my attention in this chapter was how by being wrong we get force to explore and update our believes, challenging our comfortable assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being right keeps you in place. Being wrong forces you to explore…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we’re wrong, we have to challenge our assumptions, adopt new strategies. Being wrong on its own doesn’t unlock new doors in the adjacent possible, but it does force us to look for them. &lt;a href=&quot;kindle://book?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B003ZK58TA&amp;amp;location=1565&quot;&gt;Johnson, Steven. Where Good Ideas Come From - Open in Kindle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a coincidence, right after writing this I open my twitter account to see the following tweet by Naval:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Success is the enemy of learning. It can deprive you of the time and the incentive to start over. Beginner’s mind also needs beginner’s time.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Naval (@naval) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/naval/status/957105232902696961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven mentions Charlan Nemeth who through research came out to the conclusion that good ideas are more likely to emerge in environments that contain a certain amount of noise and error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You would think that innovation would be more strongly correlated with the values of accuracy, clarity, and focus. A good idea has to be correct on some basic level, and we value good ideas because they tend to have a high signal-to-noise ratio. But that doesn’t mean you want to cultivate those ideas in noise-free environments, because noise-free environments end up being too sterile and predictable in their output. The best innovation labs are always a little contaminated. &lt;a href=&quot;kindle://book?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B003ZK58TA&amp;amp;location=1611&quot;&gt;Johnson, Steven. Where Good Ideas Come From - Open in Kindle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And concludes quoting Benjamin Franklin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative environments thrive on useful mistakes, and suffer when the demands of quality control overwhelm them&lt;/strong&gt;. Big organizations like to follow perfectionist regimes like Six Sigma and Total Quality Management, entire systems devoted to eliminating error from the conference room or the assembly line, but it’s no accident that one of the mantras of the Web startup world is fail faster. It’s not that mistakes are the goal—they’re still mistakes, after all, which is why you want to get through them quickly. &lt;strong&gt;But those mistakes are an inevitable step on the path to true innovation&lt;/strong&gt;. Benjamin Franklin, who knew a few things about innovation himself, said it best: “Perhaps the history of the errors of mankind, all things considered, is more valuable and interesting than that of their discoveries. Truth is uniform and narrow; it constantly exists, and does not seem to require so much an active energy, as a passive aptitude of soul in order to encounter it. But error is endlessly diversified.” &lt;a href=&quot;kindle://book?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B003ZK58TA&amp;amp;location=1692&quot;&gt;Johnson, Steven. Where Good Ideas Come From - Open in Kindle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pattern-6-exaptation&quot;&gt;Pattern 6: EXAPTATION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Exaptation: **: **a trait, feature, or structure of an organism or taxonomic group that takes on a function when none previously existed or that differs from its original function which had been derived by evolution.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exaptation&quot;&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exaptation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patterns show us how many inventions resulted from taking things that were not meant for that solution and putting them together to build something new. One of the examples in the book is how Gutenberg converted a machine meant to get people drunk into a printing press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An important part of Gutenberg’s genius, then, lay not in conceiving an entirely new technology from scratch, but instead from borrowing a mature technology from an entirely different field, and putting it to work to solve an unrelated problem. We don’t know exactly what chain of events led Gutenberg to make that associative link; few documentary records remain of Gutenberg’s life between 1440 and 1448, the period during which he assembled the primary components of his invention. But it is clear that Gutenberg had no formal experience pressing grapes. His radical breakthrough relied, instead, on the ubiquity of the screw press in Rhineland wine-making culture, and on his ability to reach out beyond his specific field of expertise and concoct new uses for an older technology. He took a machine designed to get people drunk and turned it into an engine for mass communication.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patterns was first coined by biologists to explain how&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An organism develops a trait optimized for a specific use, but then the trait gets hijacked for a completely different function. &lt;a href=&quot;kindle://book?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B003ZK58TA&amp;amp;location=1732&quot;&gt;Johnson, Steven. Where Good Ideas Come From - Open in Kindle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a classic example are bird feathers which&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We believe initially evolved for temperature regulation, helping nonflying dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period insulate themselves against cold weather. But when some of their descendants, including a creature we now call Archaeopteryx, began experimenting with flight, feathers turned out to be useful for controlling the airflow over the surface of the wing, allowing those first birds to glide.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author also tell us how legendary innovators end up creating great ideas thanks to their many hobbies and how been curious about many things help us exapt ideas from projects to projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Legendary innovators like Franklin, Snow, and Darwin all possess some common intellectual qualities—a certain quickness of mind, unbounded curiosity—but they also share one other defining attribute. They have a lot of hobbies …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;**That cognitive overlap is what makes this mode so innovative. The current project can exapt ideas from the projects at the margins, make new connections. It is not so much a question of thinking outside the box, as it is allowing the mind to move through multiple boxes. That movement from box to box forces the mind to approach intellectual roadblocks from new angles, or to borrow tools from one discipline to solve problems in another. **

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern era, I’d say Twitter is maybe one of the biggest example of exaptation out there, originally thought as a “micro-blogging” platform, it evolved into something that not even their founders thought it could do. How would you even describe Twitter today? Every time I open my feed there is someone doing something new with it: tweetstorms, polls, moments, personal notes saver, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pattern-7-platforms&quot;&gt;Pattern 7: PLATFORMS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last pattern in the book are platforms and tell us how platforms open many doors in the adjacent possible. To make his point, Steven starts the chapter talking about Darwin’s theory of atoll formation, then moving through beavers which by creating dams gave life to a new ecosystem, and ends up the chapter talking about recent platforms and the things they have made possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Platform building is, by definition, a kind of exercise in emergent behavior. The tiny Scleractinia polyp isn’t actively trying to create an underwater Las Vegas, but nonetheless out of its steady labor—imbibing algae and erecting those aragonite skeletons—a higher-level system emerges. What had been a largely desolate stretch of nutrient-poor seawater is transformed into a glittering hub of activity. The beaver builds a dam to better protect itself against its predators, but that engineering has the emergent effect of creating a space where kingfishers and dragonflies and beetles can make a life for themselves. The platform builders and ecosystem engineers do not just open a door in the adjacent possible. They build an entire new floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;kindle://book?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B003ZK58TA&amp;amp;location=2071&quot;&gt;Johnson, Steven. Where Good Ideas Come From - Open in Kindle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here again the author talks about the coffee-houses and interests club as platforms for new ideas to come to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most hotbeds of innovation have similar physical spaces associated with them: the Homebrew Computing Club in Silicon Valley; Freud’s Wednesday salon at 19 Berggasse; the eighteenth-century English coffeehouse. All these spaces were, in their own smaller-scale fashion, emergent platforms. Coffeehouse proprietors like Edward Lloyd or William Unwin were not trying to invent the modern publishing industry or the insurance business; they weren’t at all interested in fostering scientific advancement or political turmoil. They were just businessmen, trying to make enough sterling to feed their families, just like those beavers constructing lodges to keep their offspring safe. **But the spaces Lloyd and Unwin built turned out to have these unusual properties: they made people think differently, because they created an environment where different kinds of thoughts could productively collide and recombine. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also introduces other things like genres and they role as platform for the creation of new kind of works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Genres supply a set of implicit rules that have enough coherence that traditionalists can safely play inside them, and more adventurous artists can confound our expectations by playing with them. Genres are the platforms and paradigms of the creative world. They are almost never willed into existence by a single pioneering work. Instead, they fade into view, through a complicated set of shared signals passed between artists, each contributing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven also talks about APIs and how companies have been evolving from that “secret sauce” to fostering the idea of an open platform for others to come and built on top of them. As an example Steven uses Twitter and all the mashups that were created thanks to their open API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conventional software assumes that API users are second-class citizens who shouldn’t get full access to the software’s secret sauce for fear of losing competitive advantage. Twitter’s creators recognized that there was another kind of competitive advantage that came from complete openness: the advantage that comes from having the largest and most diverse ecosystem of software applications being built on your platform. Call it cooperative advantage. The burden of coming up with good ideas for the product is no longer shouldered exclusively by the company itself. On an open platform, good ideas can come from anywhere. &lt;a href=&quot;kindle://book?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B003ZK58TA&amp;amp;location=2225&quot;&gt;Johnson, Steven. Where Good Ideas Come From - Open in Kindle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the author also talks about the possibility for governments to benefit from the innovation engine of an emergent platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Government bureaucracies have a long and richly deserved reputation for squelching innovation, but they possess four key elements that may allow them to benefit from the innovation engine of an emergent platform. First, they are repositories of a vast amount of information and services that could be of potential value to ordinary people, if only we could organize it all better. Second, ordinary people have a passionate interest in the kind of information governments deal with, whether it’s data about industrial zoning, health-care services, or crime rates. Third, a long tradition exists of citizens committing time and intellectual energy to tackling problems where there is a perceived civic good at stake. And, finally, the fact that governments are not in the private sector means that they do not feel any competitive pressure to keep their data proprietary … But thinking of government as a platform—to borrow a phrase from Web visionary Tim O’Reilly—might be one way to carry out the promise of digital-age governance. Political leadership involves some elements that aren’t best outsourced to a liquid network; decision-making and oratory. But a good government is, at least in part, a government that comes up with innovative solutions to the problems of its citizens, or to the problems faced by bureaucracy itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this book, I think the author makes a convincing case on his theories using history, biology and other things as evidence. I found the writing style easy to follow and entertaining. I’ve been a long time fan of Steven. If you are into cryptocurrencies, he published recently an article in the New York Times about it titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/magazine/beyond-the-bitcoin-bubble.html&quot;&gt;“Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble”&lt;/a&gt; and how it might end up contributing to something bigger than wealth and he’s just starting a mailing list called “Cabinet of wonders” - you can subscribe &lt;a href=&quot;https://stevenberlinjohnson.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5185922c3f5ee66394913a782&amp;amp;id=c9142e5c21&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was going through my reading list and stumble upon an article by Ryan Holiday called &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/09/12-questions-that-will-change-your-life/&quot;&gt;12 Questions That Will Change Your Life&lt;/a&gt; - in the article Ryan presents us with 12 questions that according to him asked at the right time can change the course of our lifes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the questions in his list is “Is This In My Control?” - I want to share it here since it is highly related with my other post and made me remember that I should be focusing on the things I can control and how I respond to the things that I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is This In My Control?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Epictetus &lt;a href=&quot;http://dailystoic.com/Epictetus&quot;&gt;says that&lt;/a&gt; the chief task of the philosopher is to make the distinction between what is in their control and what is not—what is up to us and what is not up to us? We waste incredible amounts of time on the latter and leave so many opportunities on the table by mislabeling the former. Our actions, our thoughts, our feelings, these are up to us. Other people, the weather, external events, these are not. But here’s where it comes full circle: &lt;em&gt;our responses to other people, the weather, external events are in our control.&lt;/em&gt; Making this distinction will make you happier, make you stronger and make you more successful if only because it concentrates your resources in the places where they matter.

In Spanish is even harder since compassion is understood always as feeling pity for someone. Today I was going through my reading queue and found this post from the Farnam Street blog titled: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/12/against-empathy/&quot;&gt;Making Compassionate Decisions: The Role of Empathy in Decision Making&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog covers Paul Bloom’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Against-Empathy-Case-Rational-Compassion/dp/0062339338&quot;&gt;Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion&lt;/a&gt; - which tries to answer the question if empathy help us appreciate others, behave in moral ways, or help us make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found an easy way to explain the difference between empathy and compassion - that’s what I want to write in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When talking about empathy, it can be divided in two different types: Emotional or Cognitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional empathy&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the ability to feel what the other person is feeling and to certain degree &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With emotional empathy, you actually experience a weaker degree of what somebody else feels. &lt;strong&gt;Researchers in recent years have been able to show that empathic responses of pain occur in the same area of the brain where real pain is experienced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/12/against-empathy/&quot;&gt;Making Compassionate Decisions: The Role of Empathy in Decision Making&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive empathy&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the ability to understand what others are feeling without feeling the pain ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But there is another form of empathy that Bloom wants us to be aware of and consider differently. It relates to our ability to understand what is going on in the minds of others. Bloom refers to this form as cognitive empathy: … if I understand that you are in pain without feeling it myself, this is what psychologists describe as social cognition, social intelligence, mind reading, theory of mind, or mentalizing. It’s also sometimes described as a form of empathy—“cognitive empathy” as opposed to “emotional empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/12/against-empathy/&quot;&gt;Making Compassionate Decisions: The Role of Empathy in Decision Making&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about &lt;strong&gt;compassion&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compassion &lt;strong&gt;is not about sharing the same feeling or trying to understand&lt;/strong&gt; , but rather caring about how the other is feeling and trying to help them improve whatever situation they are going through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bloom references a review paper written by Tania Singer and Olga Klimecki to help make the distinction clear. Singer and Klimecki write: In contrast to empathy, &lt;strong&gt;compassion does not mean sharing the suffering of the other: rather, it is characterized by feelings of warmth, concern and care for the other, as well as a strong motivation to improve the other’s well-being. Compassion is feeling for and not feeling with the other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/12/against-empathy/&quot;&gt;Making Compassionate Decisions: The Role of Empathy in Decision Making&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shane’s summarizes the three as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Emotional empathy could be simply described as “&lt;strong&gt;feeling what others feel,”&lt;/strong&gt; cognitive empathy as &lt;strong&gt;“understanding what others feel,”&lt;/strong&gt; and compassion as &lt;strong&gt;“caring about how others feel.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.abuiles.com/reading-feed/nonviolent-communication&quot;&gt;Nonviolent Communication&lt;/a&gt;, we can get or give compassion using the four components of NVC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Four components of NVC: 1. observations 2. feelings 3. needs 4. requests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like Shane in his post, I also added the boldface in block quotes to put emphasis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve had that book in my reading list for a while after listening to an interview to the author in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/02/paul_bloom_on_e.html&quot;&gt;Econ Talk: Paul Bloom on Empathy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can checkout my notes on Nonviolent communication &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.abuiles.com/reading-feed/nonviolent-communication&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://kintrospect.com/&quot;&gt;Kintrospect&lt;/a&gt; to draft this post and consult my highlights on Shane’s post.&lt;/li&gt;

https://read.amazon.com/notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not bad, but what if I want to do something with the highlights? what if I want to compose something else based on it while being able to retain the context of where the highlight happened? What if I want a different way to internalize or share it in an structured way with my friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Amazon doesn’t offer an out of the box solution for those scenarios and as someone who enjoys not only learning and collecting new stuff but also writing about it, not having an easy way to do it was a dissatisfaction - also having to log into my Amazon account just to see the highlights was a major source of friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a problem at hand and some free time I started to hack in a tool to help me do what I wanted, I decided to called it &lt;a href=&quot;https://kintrospect.com/&quot;&gt;Kintrospect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main requirements were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should not require me to give someone else my Amazon credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should not require me to connect my Kindle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should not require me to run a third-party extension in my browser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should show me all my highlights and made them searchable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should work offline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should allow me to go easily into composition mode (no copy and paste into Evernote or other text editor).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should allow me to download a markdown file which I can then put in my blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some hacking I came up with a basic version which I’ve been using happily to write book directives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;padding: 10px&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/46DIWzeHXkQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve started to publish some of my book directives under &lt;a href=&quot;/reading-feed&quot;&gt;reading feed&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll be updating it with more books that I have read or that I’ll be reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people interested in trying Kintrospect the website is &lt;a href=&quot;https://kintrospect.com/&quot;&gt;https://kintrospect.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from others and see how they are using their Kindle highlights - Derek Sivers &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/book&quot;&gt;book page&lt;/a&gt; was a source of inpirationg and helped me understand what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you end up using the tool, plese let me know - I’d love to publish your book notes in the Kintrospect page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Until recently it was difficult to review and consume the highlights in my Kindle books and then in June (2017) Amazon launched a new page under https://read.amazon.com/notebook.</summary></entry></feed>
