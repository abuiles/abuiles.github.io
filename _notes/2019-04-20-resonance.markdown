> In mechanical systems, resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when the frequency at which a force is periodically applied is equal or nearly equal to one of the natural frequencies of the system on which it acts. This causes the system to oscillate with larger amplitude than when the force is applied at other frequencies.[3] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance


## Examples

> A familiar example is a playground swing, which acts as a pendulum. Pushing a person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the swing's natural oscillations.

> Resonance occurs widely in nature, and is exploited in many manmade devices. It is the mechanism by which virtually all sinusoidal waves and vibrations are generated. Many sounds we hear, such as when hard objects of metal, glass, or wood are struck, are caused by brief resonant vibrations in the object. Light and other short wavelength electromagnetic radiation is produced by resonance on an atomic scale, such as electrons in atoms.


Examples:

- Timekeeping mechanisms of modern clocks and watches, e.g., the balance wheel in a mechanical watch and the quartz crystal in a quartz watch
- Tidal resonance of the Bay of Fundy
- Acoustic resonances of musical instruments and the human vocal tract
- Shattering of a crystal wineglass when exposed to a musical tone of the right pitch (its resonant frequency)
- Friction idiophones, such as making a glass object (glass, bottle, vase) vibrate by rubbing around its rim with a fingertip
- Electrical resonance of tuned circuits in radios and TVs that allow radio frequencies to be selectively received
- Creation of coherent light by optical resonance in a laser cavity
- Orbital resonance as exemplified by some moons of the solar system's gas giants
- Material resonances in atomic scale are the basis of several spectroscopic techniques that are used in condensed matter physics
- Electron spin resonance
- MÃ¶ssbauer effect
- Nuclear magnetic resonance
