_Refactoring (noun)_: a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and chea
per to modify without changing its observable behavior.

_Refactoring (verb)_: to restructure software by applying a series of refactorings without changing its observable behavior.


## Why should we refactor?

1. It improves the design of the software.
2. It makes software easier to understand.
3. It helps you find bugs.
4. It helps you program faster.


## Justifying refactoring

Engineers tend to justify refactoring using moral reasons, like framing it in terms of "clean code" or "good engineering practice".

This is wrong, is not about how shinny your code is going to be after, but rather the economic implications it brings to the project.

Refactoring is first-order-negative, second-order-positive. Refactoring will compound
and pay-off over time.
