## Winner-take-all

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner-take-all_market)

> A winner-take-all market is a market in which a product or service which is only slightly (1%) better than the competitors gets disproportionally large (90%-100%) share of or all revenues for that class of products or services. It occurs when the top producer of a product earns a much more than their competitors. Examples of winner-take-all markets include the sports and entertainment markets.

## Zero-sum games

From [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zero-sum%20game)

> A situation in which one person or group can win something only by causing another person or group to lose it


From [https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/zero.html](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/zero.html)

> A zero-sum game is one in which no wealth is created or destroyed. So, in a two-player zero-sum game, whatever one player wins, the other loses. Therefore, the player share no common interests. There are two general types of zero-sum games: those with perfect information and those without.


Some examples of zero-sum games are:

 - Poker and gambling are popular examples of zero-sum games since the sum of the amounts won by some players equals the combined losses of the others.


## Non-zero-sum games

From [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/non-zero-sum-game.html](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/non-zero-sum-game.html)

> In game theory, situation where one decision maker's gain (or loss) does not necessarily result in the other decision makers' loss (or gain). In other words, where the winnings and losses of all players do not add up to zero and everyone can gain: a win-win game. See prisoner's dilemma for an illustration.
