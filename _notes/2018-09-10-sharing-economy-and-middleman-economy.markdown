## Middleman economy

## Transaction cost

Transaction costs are the expenses incurred when buying or selling a service.


## Benefits of lowering transaction cost

 - Facilitate a hybrid form of “collaborative consumption.” If you own something, you can extract some of this unused value by renting it out.
 - Three components of transaction costs become easy to negotiate: triangulation, transfer and trust
   - **Triangulation** information about identity and location, and agreeing on terms, including price **Transfer** a way of transferring payment and good that is immediate and as invisible as possible **Trust** a way of outsourcing assurance of honesty and performance of the terms of the contract.

## Software and transaction cost

Transaction costs can prevent us from helping each other. But increasingly entrepreneurs can use software to reduce transaction costs so other people can share.
