From Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_inconsistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_inconsistency)

>In economics, dynamic inconsistency or time inconsistency is a situation in which a decision-maker's preferences change over time in such a way that a preference can become inconsistent at another point in time. This can be thought of as there being many different "selves" within decision makers, with each "self" representing the decision-maker at a different point in time; the inconsistency occurs when not all preferences are aligned.

>The term "dynamic inconsistency" is more closely affiliated with game theory, whereas "time inconsistency" is more closely affiliated with behavioral economics


Time inconsistency:

  - Preference change over time in a way that become inconsistent at another point in time.
  - Give someone the choice of $500 today and $506 tomorrow and $500 in 365 days from now or $506 in 366 days from now. To be time consistent the person should choose in both scenarios the first option, however, people will choose $500 now and $506 306 days from now. Such decision is not consistent - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_inconsistency#cite_note-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_inconsistency#cite_note-1)
