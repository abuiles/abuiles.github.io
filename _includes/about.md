Hola, my name is Adolfo. I live in Medellín (Colombia) - I'm still discovering [what's next](/blog/2018/05/23/whats-next/).

I'm a person of many hobbies, some of them are:

  - Riding motorcycles.
  - Traveling.
  - Reading and writing.
  - Coding.
  - ~~Running~~ Biking.
  - Working on side-projects.

One day I want to go around the world in a motorcycle with my wife.
