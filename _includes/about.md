Hola, my name is Adolfo. I live in Medell√≠n (Colombia) where I work as an engineering manager for [Envoy](https://envoy.com/jobs/).

I do a bunch of things in my free time, some common themes are: riding motorcycles, traveling, reading, writing, coding, running or working on side-projects.

I learn best by doing, that's why I tend to always have a side-projet going on. <span class="highlight">Right now I'm focusing on [Kintrospect](https://kintrospect.com/), a tool to help people build digital commonplace books.</span>

One day I want to go around the world in a motorcycle with my wife.
