Hola, my name is Adolfo. I live in Medell√≠n (Colombia) - I'm building a Stellar anchor for Latin America.

I do a bunch of things in my free time, some common themes are:

  - Riding motorcycles.
  - Traveling.
  - Reading and writing.
  - Coding.
  - Running.
  - Working on side-projects.

One day I want to go around the world in a motorcycle with my wife.
