Hola, my name is Adolfo. I live in Medell√≠n (Colombia) where I work as an engineering manager for [Envoy](https://envoy.com/jobs/).

I do a bunch of things in my free time, some common themes are: riding motorcycles, traveling, reading, writing, coding, running or working on side-projects.

<p class="highlight">My current side-project is [Kintrospect](https://kintrospect.com/), a tool to help me build my digital common-place book and internalize what [I read](reading-feed).</p>

One day I want to go around the world in a motorcycle with my wife.
