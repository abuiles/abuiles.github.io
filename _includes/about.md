## Me
Hola, my name is Adolfo. I live in Medell√≠n (Colombia) where I work as an engineering manager for [Envoy](https://envoy.com/jobs/)

I spend most of my time using technology to bring ideas to life.

I do a bunch of things in my free time, some common themes are: riding motorcycles, traveling, reading, writing, coding, running or working on side-projects.

I like to help people, teach and to always be learning.

I learn best by doing, that's why I tend to have always a side-projet going on.

One day I want to go around the world in a motorcycle with my wife.
