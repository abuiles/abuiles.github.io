I'm available for consulting. If you answer is yes to any of the following questions, then I can help you:

 - **Are you working on a startup and need an experience product engineer/consultant?** I've done team augmentation, 1:1 tutoring, built products and teams.
 - **Are you building something with any of the following technologies: Stellar, Ember.js, React, React-Native, Ruby on Rails, AWS?** I have experience with those technologies, plus I can help you build a team to work on your product.
 - **Are you interested in growing your team and hiring people remotely?** I have built effective remote teams. I can help you find engineers, negotiate salaries and make sure that everyone is aligned with your goals and your business.
 - **Do you need someone to share ideas with and build a quick prototype?** I've been part of early stage startups as engineer and manager. I'm happy to help you validate your idea quickly and build something.

## Investing in Startups

If I believe in your idea, I'm willing to take some risk. I'd charge you less per hour and put the difference in a convertible note.
