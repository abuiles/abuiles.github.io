I'm available for consulting. If you answer is yes to any of the following questions, then I can help you:

 - Are you working on a startup and need an experience product engineer/consultant? I've done team augmentation, 1:1 tutoring, built products and teams.
 - Are you building something with any of the following technologies: Stellar, Ember.js, React, React-Native, Ruby on Rails, AWS? I have experience with those technologies, plus I can help you build a team to work on your product.
 - Are you interested in growing your team and hiring people remotely? I have built effective remote teams. I can help you find engineers, negotiate salaries and make sure that everyone is aligned with your goals.
 - Do you need someone to share ideas with and build a quick prototype? I've been part of early stage startups as engineer and manager. I'm happy to help you validate your idea quickly and build something.

## Rate
